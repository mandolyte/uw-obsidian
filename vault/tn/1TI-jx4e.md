# 1 Timothy 05 General Notes

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Honor and respect

Paul encourages younger Christians to honor and respect older Christians. Cultures honor and respect older people in different ways.

### Widows

In the ancient Near East, it was important to care for widows because they could not provide for themselves.

### Variation in names

In this chapter, as in chapter 4, Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” Here, as well, they seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
