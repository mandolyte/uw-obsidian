# Genesis 28 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Even though Jacob tricked his father in order to receive Esau’s blessing, the chapter repeats the blessing, ensuring he inherits the blessings promised to Abraham. (See: [[../bible/kt/bless]] and [[../bible/kt/inherit]] and [[../bible/kt/promise]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Jacob’s dream
Jacob had a dream or received a vision. The purpose of this dream is to show that, despite Jacob’s sin, God is giving Abraham’s covenant promises to Jacob and his descendants. (See: [[../bible/kt/sin]] and [[../bible/kt/covenant]] and [[../bible/kt/promise]])

### Bethel
This was an important city for Abraham and his descendants. It is possible that there is some theological significance to the city of Bethel.
