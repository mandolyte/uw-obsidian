# Exodus 11 General Notes


Chapter 11 is a transition point in the book. The previous nine plagues (in their three sequences of three) have come to an end and the last plague, the death of the firstborn, is about to occur along with the Passover and Exodus itself. It is difficult to know if the events in chapter 11 are all recorded in the order in which they happened. For translation, you should follow the text’s order if it will not confuse your readers.

It may be helpful to think that after the end of chapter 10, Yahweh immediately spoke to Moses, before he actually left Pharaoh’s presence (v. [1](../11/01.md)-[2](../11/02.md)). [Verse 3](../11/03.md) is a comment suggesting that the Egyptians will be willing to do as the Israelites are told to ask them to do in [v. 2](../11/02.md). In verses [4](../11/04.md)-[7](../11/07.md) Moses gives Pharaoh and his officials a message from Yahweh that Yahweh is giving to Moses right at that moment. At the end of [v. 8](../11/08.md) Moses leaves Pharaoh’s presence (completing the interaction from the [end of ch. 10](../10/28.md)). [Verse 9](../11/09.md) may either be Yahweh telling Moses what is going to happen, or it could be part of the summary that occurs in [v. 10](../11/10.md). Verse 10 summarizes what has happened in chs. 5-10 (especially the plagues in chs. 7-10) in preparation for the great last plague.


## Special concepts in this chapter

### Pharaoh’s hard heart

Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.

### Let my people go

In the previous chapters, Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he demanded that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people. In this chapter, the same wording is used to refer to Pharaoh “allowing” the Hebrew people to leave Egypt.
