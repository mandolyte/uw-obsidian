# Philippians 04 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### “My joy and my crown”
Paul had helped the Philippians become spiritually mature. As a result, Paul rejoiced and God honored him and his work. He considered discipling other Christians and encouraging them to grow spiritually as important to Christian living.
