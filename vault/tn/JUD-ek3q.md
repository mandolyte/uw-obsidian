# General Information:

Jude identifies himself as the writer of this letter and greets his readers. He was probably the half-brother of Jesus. There are two other Judes mentioned in the New Testament. The word “you” in this letter refers to the Christians to whom Jude was writing and is always plural. (See: [[figs-you]])
