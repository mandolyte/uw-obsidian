### Building the temple
David wanted to build a temple for God but God would not allow him to. Instead he promised that his son, Solomon, would build the temple and he promised David would have a descendant who would be king forever. (See: [[../bible/kt/temple]] and [[../bible/kt/promise]] and [[../bible/kt/eternity]])
