# General Information:

Verse 1 gives background information about the people in the church at Antioch. Here the first word “they” probably refers to these five leaders but may also include the other believers. The next words “they” and “their” probably refer to the other three leaders not including Barnabas and Saul but could include other believers. (See: [[writing-background]])
