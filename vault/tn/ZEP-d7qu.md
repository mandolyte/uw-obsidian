# General Information:

In verses 3:1-5, Zephaniah speaks Yahweh’s message of judgment to the sinful people of Jerusalem. The city represents the people who live within it. To make this clear, it may be helpful to replace the singular “she” and “her” with the plural “they” and “their.” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])
