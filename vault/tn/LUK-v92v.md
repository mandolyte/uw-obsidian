## Special concepts in this chapter

### Judges

People expected judges always to do what God said was right and to make sure that other people did what was right. But some judges did not care about doing right or making sure others did right. Jesus called this kind of judge “unjust.” (See: [[../bible/kt/justice]])

### Pharisees and tax collectors

The Pharisees thought that they themselves were the best examples of righteous good people, and they thought that tax collectors were the most unrighteous sinners. (See: [[../bible/kt/righteous]] and [[../bible/kt/sin]])

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### “that he had become sad”

At the beginning of 18:24, in the story of the ruler who asked Jesus how he could have eternal life, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible say that Jesus saw “that he had become sad.” However, the ancient manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not have that phrase. They say simply that Jesus looked at him. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote. UST represents the phrase in its text.

### “we have left everything”

In 18:28, in some ancient manuscripts of the Bible, Peter says that the disciples have left “everything” to follow Jesus. In other manuscripts, the expression is “our own possessions.” ULT says “everything” in its text, but it acknowledges the possibility “our own possessions” in a footnote. UST, expanding on the meaning of “everything,” accommodates both possibilities by saying “everything we had.”

In each of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT, or you may wish to offer a reading like the one in UST. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
