### What is the Book of Ruth about?

This book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book traditionally has the title **Ruth** because she is the main person in it. Translators can use a title such as **The Book about Ruth**. (See: [[translate-names]])

### When did the events in the Book of Ruth occur?

The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were **judges** in Israel. This was after the people of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, but before they had a king. The “judges” were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts

### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?

In a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab shows great faith in him. The Israelites’ frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])

### What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth?

Israelites practiced what is called **levirate marriage**. In this custom, the closest male relative of a man who died without any children was obligated to provide for his widow by marrying her. Usually this would be one of the man’s brothers. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could fulfil this obligation.

### What was a **kinsman-redeemer**?

A person’s close relative or relatives were expected to act as **kinsmen-redeemers** (2:20 ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need, fulfil obligations of **levirate marriage**, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.

### What was **gleaning** in the Book of Ruth?

In Israel, poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These **gleaners** picked up stalks of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.

### What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?

A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do, according to the covenant that they had made. God made a covenant with Israel, in which he promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.

The Book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives is part of Israel’s duties in God’s covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth, and Naomi gives examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])

### What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?

City gates in the time of Boaz were meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were thick, especially at the entryways, and the gates had guard towers beside and above them. Therefore the gateway opening provided a large shady area for public meetings, and there were places for important people to sit. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.

Some English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting **at** the city gate, but it may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat **in** the city gateway.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### How does the Book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?

The Book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as **so,** **then,** and **now**. Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.
