# 1 Timothy 04 General Notes

## Special concepts in this chapter

Paul speaks in [4:14](./14.md) of prophecy. A “prophecy” is a message that God communicates to people through someone to whom He has given a special gift of hearing and conveying these messages. The specific prophecy that Paul describes revealed how Timothy would become a gifted leader of the church. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Cultural practices

In verse 14 Paul speaks of church leaders placing their hands on Timothy. That was one way of indicating publicly that a person was being placed in a leadership position in the church.

### Variation in names

In this chapter Paul speaks of church leaders called “elders.” They seem to be the same kind of leaders that he calls “overseers” in chapter 3.
