# General Information:

As [7:8–9](../07/08.md) indicates, this was specifically in the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “during the seventh year of the reign of Artaxerxes as king of Persia.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])
