# 2 Chronicles 26 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Uzzah the leper
Uzzah was powerful when he followed Yahweh. When he entered the temple to burn incense like a priest, God made him a leper. Lepers could not properly worship Yahweh because they were always unclean. (See: [[../bible/kt/temple]] and [[../bible/kt/priest]] and [[../bible/kt/clean]])
