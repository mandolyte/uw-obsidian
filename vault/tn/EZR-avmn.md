# General Information:

This means the temple. The officials speak of it figuratively as if it were a place in which God would live. (They likely say **the great God** because the Jews told them, as they report in [5:11](../05/11.md), that it would be a temple for the God who made heaven and earth.) Alternate translation: “to the temple of the great God” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])
