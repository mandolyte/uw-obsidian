# Connecting Statement:

Although Ezra speaks of Yahweh in the third person here, he is actually praying a prayer of thanksgiving to Yahweh. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate his words in the second person. Alternate translation: “Thank you, Yahweh” (See: [[figs-123person]])
