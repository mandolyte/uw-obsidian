### ὁ πρεσβύτερος (1)
In this culture, letter writers would give their own names first, referring to themselves in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you can use the first person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the author of a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “I, the elder, am writing this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

## z4tk
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### ὁ πρεσβύτερος (1)
**The elder** likely means John, the apostle and disciple of Jesus. He refers to himself as “elder” either because of his old age, or because he is a leader in the church, or both. If you have a term for an older, respected leader, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “I, John, am writing this letter” or Alternate translation: “I, John the elder, am writing this letter” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## y7hw
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person
### ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς (1)
In this culture, letter writers would name the addressees next, referring to them in the third person. If that is confusing in your language, you can use the second person here. Or if your language has a particular way of introducing the person who receives a letter, and if it would be helpful to your readers, you can use it here. Alternate translation: “to you, chosen lady, and to your children” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

## a9w3
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ (1)
There are two possibilities for the meaning of **chosen lady**. (1) John is writing to a church and figuratively describing the group of believers as a “lady.” (In Greek, the word for “church” is feminine.) (2) John may be writing to a specific woman and referring to her respectfully as “lady.” Alternate translation: “to the chosen church” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## ueev
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom
### ἐκλεκτῇ κυρίᾳ (1)
In this context, the term **chosen** indicates a person or group of people whom God has chosen to receive salvation. Alternate translation: “to the congregation that God has saved” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## axty
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### καὶ τοῖς τέκνοις αὐτῆς (1)
There are three possibilities for the meaning of **her children**. (1) Just as **chosen lady** figuratively refers to a church, here **her children** refers figuratively to the people who are part of that church. Alternate translation: “and to the believers in that group” (2) If this letter is addressed to an actual woman, it could refer to her biological children, or (3) it could refer figuratively to people whom the woman has led to faith as her spiritual children. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## src4
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns
### ἀγαπῶ ἐν ἀληθείᾳ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an equivalent expression. This could mean one of two things. (1) The phrase **the truth** describes how John loves. Alternate translation: “truly love” (2) The phrase **the truth** provides the reason for John’s love. Alternate translation: “love because we both know the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

## a50f
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole
### πάντες οἱ ἐγνωκότες τὴν ἀλήθειαν (1)
John uses the phrase **all who have known the truth** to refer to believers who know and accept the true message about Jesus Christ. John is most likely using the term **all** as a generalization to mean all the believers who are with him and who know the people of this church. Alternate translation: “all who are with me and who know and accept the truth” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])

# 1:2
## spdg
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns
### τὴν ἀλήθειαν (1)
John uses the abstract noun **truth** to refer to the true message that Christians believe. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind this term with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “the true message” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

## et6b
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive
### ἡμῖν & ἡμῶν (1)
If your language marks this distinction, the pronoun **us** would be inclusive here and throughout the epistle, because John always uses it to refer to both himself and to the recipients of the letter. The pronoun “we” would also be inclusive for that same reason, as would the pronoun “our,” if you choose to use it in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

## a7rm
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom
### εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα (1)
This is an idiom. Alternate translation: “for all time” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

### ἔσται μεθ’ ἡμῶν χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη, παρὰ Θεοῦ Πατρός καὶ παρὰ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract nouns **grace**, **mercy**, and **peace** with verbal phrases, with **God the Father** and **Jesus Christ** as the subject. Alternate translation: “God the Father and Jesus Christ will be kind to us, be merciful to us, and enable us to be peaceful” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

## zfgr
### ἔσται μεθ’ ἡμῶν χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη (1)
In this culture, letter writers would normally offer a good wish or blessing for the recipients before introducing the main business of the letter. But instead of a blessing here, John makes a declarative statement. This probably expresses his confidence that God will do as he promised. Be sure that your translation also expresses this confidence.

## vpl9
rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples
### Πατρός & Υἱοῦ (1)
**Father** and **Son** are important titles that describe the relationship between God and Jesus Christ. Be sure to translate them accurately and consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

## w6tr
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns
### ἐν ἀληθείᾳ καὶ ἀγάπῃ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **truth** and **love** with adjectives or verbs. There are two possibilities for the meaning of these abstract nouns here. (1) They describe qualities of God the Father and Jesus Christ. Alternative translation: “who are truthful and loving” (2) They describe how believers should live, and thus are the conditions under which believers will receive the **grace, mercy, and peace** from God. Alternative translation: “as we continue to hold on to what is true and to love each other” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

# 1:4
## ir6v

## ajlf
rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result
### ἐχάρην λείαν (1)

## a3vs
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### τῶν τέκνων σου (1)
See how you translated the term **children** in [1:1](../01/1.md). This could mean one of three things. (1) This refers to the people who are part of a certain congregation.

Alternate translation: “the believers from your group” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## w2b6
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor

## s7hr
### καθὼς ἐντολὴν ἐλάβομεν παρὰ τοῦ Πατρός (1)
The expression **received a commandment** expresses the idea that God commanded the believers to do something. If it would be clearer in your language, you could make **the Father** the subject of a sentence with the verb “command.” Alternate translation: “just as the Father has commanded us”

## w7f1
rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples
### τοῦ Πατρός (1)
**Father** is an important title for God. Be careful to translate it accurately and consistently. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples]])

# 1:5
## r4hx

## c9xi
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you

## u38f
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### οὐχ ὡς ἐντολὴν καινὴν γράφων σοι (1)
John does not refer to himself explicitly as the person writing. If your language requires you to state the subject of a verb, you could add a pronoun here. Alternate translation: “not as though I were writing you a new commandment” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## uhs8
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### ἀπ’ ἀρχῆς (1)

## nw4g
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### περιπατῶμεν κατὰ & ἐν & περιπατῆτε (1)

## cl95
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you
### ἠκούσατε & περιπατῆτε (1)
The term **you** is plural in this verse, because John is addressing a congregation of believers. This is the case throughout the rest of the letter, as well, except in verse 13, because there John returns to his metaphor of referring to a church as a woman and its members as her children. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])

# 1:7
## u749
rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result
### ὅτι (1)
Here, **for** introduces the reason why John wrote about the commandment to love and obey God in the previous verses - it is because there are many who pretend to be believers but they do not love or obey God. Use a natural way to introduce this reason in your language. See the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## w25m
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### ὅτι πολλοὶ πλάνοι ἐξῆλθαν εἰς τὸν κόσμον (1)
This seems to be an implicit reference to the false teachers whom John discusses in [verses 10–11](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: “For many deceivers are going around from place to place” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## x8yl
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy
### Ἰησοῦν Χριστὸν ἐρχόμενον ἐν σαρκί (1)

## vqnb
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### οὗτός ἐστιν ὁ πλάνος καὶ ὁ ἀντίχριστος (1)
There are two possibilities for what the word **this** refers to. (1) John is referring to the activity of deceiving others or to the kind of teaching that these people are doing. Alternate translation: “This is the work of the deceiver, the antichrist” or “This kind of teaching comes from the one who is the deceiver and the antichrist” (2) John may be referring to any member of the group of deceivers. Alternate translation: “Any such person is the deceiver and the antichrist” If it would be helpful, you can make one of these meanings explicit. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

## vfdn
### ὁ πλάνος καὶ ὁ ἀντίχριστος (1)
In your translation, it may be helpful to clarify that **the deceiver** and **the antichrist** are one person, not two.

rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### πᾶς ὁ προάγων καὶ μὴ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ (1)
John refers to **the teaching of Christ** figuratively as a place where faithful believers **remain** and also as a place that false teachers leave as they go **beyond**. The expression **goes beyond** refers to teaching new and false things that Jesus did not teach. Alternate translation: “everyone who teaches things that Jesus did not teach” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## x3ae
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure
### πᾶς ὁ προάγων καὶ μὴ μένων ἐν τῇ διδαχῇ τοῦ Χριστοῦ (1)
These two phrases mean the same thing, one stated positively (**goes beyond**) and the other stated negatively (**does not remain**). If it is mote natural in your language, you can reverse the order of these, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

## xty9

## vg19
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj
### οὗτος (1)
John is using the demonstrative adjective **this** as a noun, to refer to a kind of person. ULT indicates this by adding the word **one**. If your language does not use adjectives in this way, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “such a person” or “that kind of person” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])

rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### εἴ τις ἔρχεται πρὸς ὑμᾶς, καὶ ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν οὐ φέρει (1)

## xafi
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### καὶ ταύτην τὴν διδαχὴν οὐ φέρει (1)

## ls1c
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit

## lbct
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit
### χαίρειν αὐτῷ μὴ λέγετε (1)
John warns the believers not to greet a false teacher respectfully in public. The implication is that he does not want them to do anything that might look like they are endorsing a false teacher or that would give a false teacher good standing in the eyes of others.

### οὐκ ἐβουλήθην διὰ χάρτου καὶ μέλανος (1)
Here John leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could supply these words from earlier in the sentence. Alternate translation: “I did not want to write these things with paper and ink” (See: Ellipsis)(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])

## nx77
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy
### διὰ χάρτου καὶ μέλανος (1)
John is not saying that he would rather write these things with something other than **paper and ink**. Rather, he is speaking figuratively of those writing materials to represent writing in general. He means that he wants to visit the believers personally and to continue his communication with them directly. Alternate translation: “to communicate these things in writing” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive
### ἵνα ἡ χαρὰ ὑμῶν πεπληρωμένη ᾖ (1)

## fh6j
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor
### τὰ τέκνα τῆς ἀδελφῆς σου τῆς ἐκλεκτῆς (1)
This expression could mean one of several things. (1) This is a metaphor. Just as John uses the term “chosen lady” as a figurative expression for the group of believers to whom he is writing in [verse 1](../01/01.md) and the term “her children” for the members of that group, also here John is figuratively describing his own group of believers as the **chosen sister** of that group and the members of his group as the **children** of this sister. Alternate translation: “the members of the chosen group of believers here” If you choose to keep the metaphor in the text, you may want to include an explanation of the meaning in a footnote. (2) This could refer to the biological children of a specific woman who is the biological sister of another specific woman to whom John is writing. (3) John could be using the words **sister** and **children** figuratively in a spiritual sense, but to refer to an individual woman and the other people that she has led to faith in Jesus. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## aonw
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom

Alternate translation: “the members of this group of believers in Jesus” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

## a4rc
### ἀσπάζεταί σε (1)
As was customary in this culture, John concludes the letter by extending greetings from people who are with him and who know the people to whom he is writing. Your language may have a particular way of sharing greetings in a letter. If so, you can use that form here. Alternate translation: “send you their greetings” or “ask to be remembered to you”

## qjdz
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you
### σε & σου (1)
The pronouns **you** and **your** are singular here, in keeping with John’s metaphor of writing to a congregation as though it were a lady. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
