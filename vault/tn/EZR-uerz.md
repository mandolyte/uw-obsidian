# General Information:

Ezra’s genealogy in [7:1–6](../07/01.md) traces Ezra back to Aaron in a list of 16 ancestors. As is common in ancient genealogies, this list almost certainly does not include all of the generations between Aaron and Ezra. Aaron [(7:5)](../07/05.md) was the first high priest under the law of Moses and the first to serve in the tabernacle. Azariah [(7:3)](../07/03.md) was the first high priest to serve in the temple that Solomon built, which this book describes in [5:11](../05/11.md). Seraiah was the last high priest to serve in that temple. The Babylonians executed him when they conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple. The names in the list are arranged so that there will be seven generations between Aaron and Azariah, and seven generations between Azariah and Ezra, with Seraiah listed as the last generation before Ezra. If you have the freedom to use formatting creatively in your translation, you could make the implicit information about Aaron, Azariah, and Seraiah explicit and format this genealogy in a way that will highlight its purpose and design. Alternate translation and formatting:
