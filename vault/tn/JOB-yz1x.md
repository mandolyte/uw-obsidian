# Job 25 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

The ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because it is a poem. This chapter is a continuation of the advice of Job’s friend, Bildad. His words in this chapter are much stronger than when he previously spoke.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### God’s holiness and man’s sin
Bildad describes the holiness of Yahweh and the universal nature of man’s sinfulness. While his points are accurate, they are not convincing for Job because he has been righteous. (See: [[../bible/kt/holy]] and [[../bible/kt/sin]] and [[../bible/kt/righteous]])

## Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Rhetorical questions
Bildad uses many different rhetorical questions in this chapter in order to try to convince Job that he is wrong. These questions help to build Bildad’s argument. (See: [[figs-rquestion]])
