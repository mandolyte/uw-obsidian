## Special concepts in this chapter

### “You will catch men”

Peter, James, and John were fishermen. When Jesus told them that they would catch men, he was using a metaphor to tell them he wanted them to help people believe the good news about him. See the last note to 5:10. (See: [[../bible/kt/disciple]] and [[figs-metaphor]])

### Sinners

When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses. But when Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who understand that they are sinners who have disobeyed God can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[../bible/kt/sin]])

### Fasting and feasting

People would fast, or not eat food for a long time, when they were sad or in order to show God that they were sorry for their sins. When they were happy, such as during weddings, they would have feasts, or meals where they would eat much food. (See: [[../bible/other/fast]])

## Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Healthy and sick people

To correct the Pharisees, Jesus speaks of healthy people who do not need a doctor. This does not mean that there are people who do not need Jesus. Rather, Jesus was explaining why he spent time with people whom the Pharisees considered to be “sinners.” See the notes to 5:31–32. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Implicit information

In several parts of this chapter, as in other places in the book, Luke does not explain information that his original readers would already have understood. Modern readers might not know some of those things, so they might have trouble understanding all that Luke is communicating. The alternate translations in these notes and the readings in UST often illustrate how that information can be presented so that modern readers will be able to understand these passages. (See: [[translate-unknown]] and [[figs-explicit]])

### Past events

Parts of this chapter are sequences of events that have already happened. In a given passage, Luke sometimes writes as if the events have already happened while other events are still in progress (even though they are complete at the time he writes). This can cause difficulty in translation by creating an illogical order of events. It may be necessary to make these consistent by writing as if all the events have already happened.
