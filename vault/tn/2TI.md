Alternate translation: “suffer together with all believers” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## juu2
### ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ (1)
Paul compares suffering for Christ Jesus to the suffering that a good soldier endures. Alternate translation: “as if you were a soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 2:4
## a4x7
### οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις (1)
To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a soldier who has to decide between pleasing his leader or pleasing those outside the army. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this. Alternate translation: “consider that no dedicated soldier allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p7n5
### ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις (1)
Paul speaks of being involved in other matters as if they were a net that trapped people and kept them from being able to move freely. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p028
### ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις (1)
If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “allows the affairs of life to distract him” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## p029
### τοῦ βίου (1)
By **life**, Paul means, in the context of this metaphor, “civilian life.” The implication is that Timothy and all believers should not allow competing concerns to keep them from serving Christ. Alternate translation: “of everyday life” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## d2lg
### τῷ στρατολογήσαντι (1)
Alternate translation: “his leader” or “the one who commands him”

# 2:5
## d483
### ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ (1)
To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of an athlete who has to decide between competing lawfully or not lawfully. The athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes lawfully. By making this comparison with an athlete competing in games, Paul is implicitly telling Timothy that Christ will not reward him unless he serves him **lawfully**, that is, unless he obeys him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “consider that the officials only crown an athlete as the winner if he competes according to the rules” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p031
### ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις, οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ (1)
Paul is also using a hypothetical situation to teach Timothy. Alternate translation: “suppose an athlete did not compete by the rules. Then he would not be crowned” (See: [[figs-hypo]])

## p032
### ἐὰν & ἀθλῇ τις (1)
Here, **competes** refers to competing in an athletic event. Alternate translation: “if an athlete competes in an event”

## xbn6
### οὐ στεφανοῦται, ἐὰν μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this double negative as a positive statement. Alternate translation: “the officials will only crown him if he competes by the rules” (See: [[figs-doublenegatives]])

## p033
### οὐ στεφανοῦται (1)
If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## p034
### οὐ στεφανοῦται (1)
Paul assumes that Timothy will know that in this culture crowning indicated the winner of a competition. Alternate translation: “the officials will not crown him as the winner” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## lea8
### οὐ στεφανοῦται (1)
In Paul’s time, when athletes won competitions, they were crowned with wreaths made from the leaves of plants. You can express this idea in your translation by referring to the comparable custom in your own culture, or by using a general expression. Alternate translation: “the officials will not give him an award” or “the officials will not declare him to be the winner” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## reg6
### μὴ νομίμως ἀθλήσῃ (1)
Paul is referring to the rules that governed a competition. The athletes had to obey the rules or they would be removed from the competition and not have an opportunity to win. If it would be clearer in your language, you can mention these rules. Alternate translation: “he does not compete according to the rules” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 2:6
## wz35
### τὸν κοπιῶντα γεωργὸν δεῖ πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν (1)
To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor of a farmer who has to decide between working hard or not working hard. The farmer will receive a share of the harvest if he is working hard. By making this comparison, Paul is encouraging Timothy to work hard in his service to Christ so that God will reward him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this directly. Alternate translation: “Consider that a farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crops before anyone else” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p035
### πρῶτον τῶν καρπῶν μεταλαμβάνειν (1)
In this illustration, it seems that the hardworking farmer is working with other farmers who will all receive a part of the crop after the harvest. But since this farmer works harder than the others, he should receive before the others. It is implied that receiving first is best, possibly because the quality of the crop is better. Alternate translation: “receive the best share of the crops” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 2:7
## bdk9
### νόει ὃ λέγω, δώσει γάρ σοι ὁ Κύριος σύνεσιν (1)
Paul gave Timothy three metaphors in verses 3-6, but he did not completely explain their implications. He expected Timothy to figure out, with God’s help, the lesson of these metaphors for Christ’s servants. For that reason, if you want to include an explanation of the meaning of the metaphors, we recommend that you state the meaning in a footnote rather than in the Bible text. Alternate translation: “you will have to think carefully about what I have just told you to understand it completely, but you can depend on God to help you to do that” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## p036
### ὃ λέγω (1)
Paul refers to what he has just written in his letter with the verb **saying** to express the idea of communicating. Alternate translation: “what I have just told you” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## a22q
### ἐν πᾶσιν (1)
Here, **in everything** refers to everything related to the three metaphors that Paul has written just before this. Alternate translation: “about everything that I have just said” or “about all that I said” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 2:8
## mh1k
### ἐκ σπέρματος Δαυείδ (1)
The phrase **from the seed of** refers figuratively to Jesus being descended from King David. Alternate translation: “who is a descendant of David” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p037
### Δαυείδ (1)
This is the name of a man, a great king of Israel. (See: [[translate-names]])

## wt31
### ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν (1)
The expression **raise from the dead** is an idiom for causing someone who has died to become alive again. Alternate translation: “whom God caused to live again” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## p038
### ἐγηγερμένον ἐκ νεκρῶν (1)
If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “whom God raised from the dead” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## s4vh
### κατὰ τὸ εὐαγγέλιόν μου (1)
The term **my** conveys the idea that it is the gospel associated with Paul because he preaches it. Alternate translation: “according to the gospel message that I preach” (See: [[figs-possession]])

# 2:9
## t2ax
### μέχρι δεσμῶν (1)
Paul uses the expression **unto chains** figuratively to express how far his suffering has gone: from being beaten, to being arrested, to being in chains in prison. Alternate translation: “to the point of being imprisoned” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## p039
### ὡς κακοῦργος (1)
Paul compares his situation to the shameful one that a person would be in who had actually committed a crime. Alternate translation: “as if I were a criminal” (See: [[figs-simile]])

## pc6t
### ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται (1)
Here, **bound** means being held in chains as a prisoner, referring to Paul’s condition. Paul contrasts himself, an actual prisoner, with God’s message, which can never be held prisoner. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p040
### ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ οὐ δέδεται (1)
If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this idea. Alternate translation: “nothing is holding back the message from God” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## p041
### ὁ λόγος τοῦ Θεοῦ (1)
Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to describe the message from God that he and others are communicating with words. Alternate translation: “the message from God” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 2:10
## p042
### πάντα ὑπομένω (1)
Here the term **all** is a generalization that likely refers to the sufferings that Paul describes in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “I endure all of these sufferings” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## aa1x
### διὰ τοὺς ἐκλεκτούς (1)
The term **chosen** is an adjective that functions as a noun here and refers to a group of people. If your language would not use an adjective in that way, you can translate this term with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “for the people whom God has chosen” (See: [[figs-nominaladj]])

## j2bk
### αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ (1)
The phrase **obtain the salvation** could also be expressed with Christ Jesus, who grants salvation, as the subject. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may grant them salvation”

## p043
### αὐτοὶ σωτηρίας τύχωσιν τῆς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **salvation** with a verb. Alternate translation: “Christ Jesus may save them” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## el68
### μετὰ δόξης αἰωνίου (1)
The abstract noun **glory** refers to the wonderful condition that people will experience when they are in the presence of God. It comes from God himself and he shares it with those who are saved by Jesus Christ, and this condition is **eternal**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **glory** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “and know how glorious it is to be with God forever” or “and experience God’s wonderful presence forever” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 2:11
## nr7u
### πιστὸς ὁ λόγος (1)
In this context, the term **word** refers to the statement of doctrine that follows. See how you translated this phrase in [1 Timothy 1:15](../../1ti/01/15.md) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”

## p044
### πιστὸς ὁ λόγος (1)
You could represent the meaning of the adjective **trustworthy** with an active verb, if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “you can trust this statement”

## p045
### πιστὸς ὁ λόγος (1)
Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation. The words that follow in the rest of this verse and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md) are a poem or hymn that expresses the message that Paul says is trustworthy. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these words as a direct quotation or by setting them farther to the right, as the General Notes at the beginning of this chapter suggest. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## g6e4
### εἰ γὰρ συναπεθάνομεν, καὶ συνζήσομεν (1)
This is the beginning of a poem or hymn that Paul is probably quoting. If your language has a way of indicating that this is poetry, such as by setting individual phrases on separate lines, you could use it here and in [2:12](../02/12.md) and [2:13](../02/13.md). If not, you could translate this material as regular prose rather than as poetry. (See: [[writing-poetry]])

## in38
### εἰ & συναπεθάνομεν (1)
Paul is speaking figuratively since he and Timothy and other believers who should trust this statement have not actually died. This could mean one of two things. (1) Paul could be referring to the way that believers accept Jesus’ death for their sins when they trust him for salvation. This means that they have figuratively “died” to their old life of sin. Alternate translation: “if we have ended our old way of life by accepting Jesus’ death for us” (2) Paul could be referring to the way that people who believe in Jesus may suffer for him, possibly to the point of dying for him. Alternate translation: “if we are prepared to die for Jesus” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p046
### καὶ συνζήσομεν (1)
Although Paul is referring to dying with Christ in a figurative sense, **live** is probably not figurative, but refers to one of two things. (1) **live** refers to life after physical death. This seems most likely given Paul’s mention of “eternal glory” in the previous verse and “we will reign with him” in the next. Alternate translation: “then God will raise us from the dead to live with Jesus” (2) **live** refers to how believers will act in this life before physical death. Alternate translation: “we will not pursue our own desires, instead we will do what Jesus wants us to do”

# 2:12
## p048
### εἰ ἀρνησόμεθα (1)
Paul uses the term **deny** to refer to the action of believers saying that they do not know Jesus Christ during this present life. It is presented as the opposite of **endure**, so it refers to someone who gives in to persecution and denies being a follower of Jesus. Alternate translation: “if we say now that we do not know him”

## p049
### κἀκεῖνος ἀρνήσεται ἡμᾶς (1)
In this second usage of the word **deny**, Paul is referring to the action of Jesus Christ on the day of final judgment. On that day, Jesus will either receive a faithful believer or reject those who are not true followers. Those who deny that they are followers of Jesus while on earth are not true followers. Alternate translation: “he will reject us on the day of judgment”

# 2:13
## ke4w
### εἰ ἀπιστοῦμεν (1)
Paul uses the word **unfaithful** to express the condition of believers who do not continue to obey Jesus, but rather disobey him. Alternate translation: “if we disobey Jesus” or “if we do not do what Jesus wants us to do”

## p050
### ἐκεῖνος πιστὸς μένει (1)
This could mean one of two things. Alternate translation: (1) “he remains faithful to us” (2) “he remains true to himself” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## ihd4
### ἀρνήσασθαι & ἑαυτὸν οὐ δύναται (1)
Paul states that Jesus is not able to **deny himself**, meaning that Jesus is not able to go against his character and will remain true to what he said he would do. Paul may have one or both of the following ideas in mind. (1) Jesus’ character includes being the Savior who can forgive our unfaithfulness when we repent of it, as Peter experienced (John 21:15-19). This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains faithful to us.” (2) Jesus’ character also includes being the holy God who judges people for their sin when they do not repent. This favors the interpretation of the previous phrase as “he remains true to himself.” Alternate translation: “he must always act according to his character”

# 2:14
## u661
### ὑπομίμνῃσκε (1)
The word **them**, which is implicit in the Greek verb, probably refers to the people that Timothy has responsibility over. Alternate translation: “remind the people there”

## p051
### ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ (1)
Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Seeing, in turn, figuratively means attention and judgment. Alternate translation: “as God is watching” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## r5lq
### ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ (1)
The implication is that Paul is telling Timothy to tell the believers, when he gives them this command, that God will be watching what they do. Alternate translation: “with God as their witness” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## g6p7
### μὴ λογομαχεῖν (1)
Paul uses the term **battle** figuratively to describe arguments. This could mean one of two things. (1) The believers are not to argue about unimportant things such as the words that someone uses to present the gospel message. That only distracts people from talking about important things, such as the gospel message itself. Alternate translation: “not to fight about small things like words” (2) The believers are not to argue about what words mean. Again, this causes disunity among the believers for no good reason. Alternate translation: “not to fight about the meanings of words” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## rke6
### ἐπ’ οὐδὲν χρήσιμον (1)
Paul adds that battling about words has no benefit for those involved. Alternate translation: “it does not benefit anyone”

## ywty
### ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **destruction** with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “it destroys those who hear” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## x7gx
### ἐπὶ καταστροφῇ τῶν ἀκουόντων (1)
Here, **destruction** refers not to physical harm, but to the spiritual harm that is done to believers who hear their teachers foolishly arguing about unimportant things. This teaches the believers that being seen as right about small things is more important than love and unity, and can cause them to have wrong ideas about the faith or to stop following Jesus altogether. Alternate translation: “and can make those who hear it want to stop following Jesus” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 2:15
## m3vy
### σπούδασον σεαυτὸν, δόκιμον παραστῆσαι τῷ Θεῷ (1)
Alternate translation: “do your best to please God”

## rj6y
### ἐργάτην (1)
Paul says figuratively that Timothy will be a skilled workman if he correctly teaches God’s word. Alternate translation: “like a craftsman” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## xgz9
### ὀρθοτομοῦντα τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας (1)
Paul refers figuratively to **the word of truth** as if it were a path that someone was cutting through difficult terrain. When such a path is **straight**, travelers can follow it directly to their destination. By contrast, the useless discussions that Paul describes in [2:14](../02/14.md) and [2:16](../02/16.md) would be needless detours in terms of this same metaphor. Alternate translation: “show people how to follow the Scriptures directly” or “teach the Scriptures correctly so that people can follow them” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p052
### τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας (1)
Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. This could mean one of two things. (1) It could refer to the message that Timothy is to teach. Alternate translation: “the true message” (2) It could refer to the Scriptures. Alternate translation: “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## p053
### τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “the true message” or “the true things that God has said in the Scriptures” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 2:16
## e27q
### ἐπὶ πλεῖον & προκόψουσιν ἀσεβείας (1)
Paul speaks of these discussions figuratively as if they could physically progress in a certain direction, and he speaks of godlessness as that direction. Paul is figuratively describing the effect that these discussions have on people. Alternate translation: “because they cause people to become more and more ungodly” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 2:17
## i73t
### ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν ὡς γάγγραινα νομὴν ἕξει (1)
This is a simile. It means that something will spread from person to person and harm the faith of all those who hear it. The thing that will spread is either: (1) the habit of having useless and godless discussions, or (2) the things that the people were saying in these empty discussions, or both. Alternate translation: “these empty discussions will spread quickly and cause destruction like an infectious disease” (See: [[figs-simile]])

## p054
### ὁ λόγος αὐτῶν (1)
Paul uses the term **word** figuratively to refer to something that is expressed in words. Alternate translation: “these discussions” or “what people who take part in these discussions say” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## p055
### ὡς γάγγραινα (1)
**Gangrene** is type of tissue death caused by infection or lack of blood circulation. It quickly spreads in a person’s body and can lead to death. If your readers would not know what **gangrene** is, you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: “like an infectious disease” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## p056
### ὧν ἐστιν Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος (1)
Paul gives Timothy the names of two men who are examples of ungodliness and foolish talk. To make the relationship between these names and the preceding **their word** clear in your language, you may have to make this explicit. Alternate translation: “Hymeneus and Philetus are such people” (See: [[writing-pronouns]])

## x2k6
### Ὑμέναιος, καὶ Φίλητος (1)
These are names of men. (See: [[translate-names]])

# 2:18
## fi9z
### οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν (1)
Paul uses this expression to speak figuratively of faith in Christ as if it were a target at which people should aim. Those who have **missed the mark** do not believe or teach what is true. Alternate translation: “who are teaching things that are not true” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p057
### οἵτινες περὶ τὴν ἀλήθειαν ἠστόχησαν (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **truth** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “who teach things that are not true” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## pu22
### ἀνάστασιν ἤδη γεγονέναι (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **resurrection** with an equivalent expression. Alternative translation: “God has already raised the dead” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## ura5
### ἀνατρέπουσιν τήν τινων πίστιν (1)
Paul refers to **faith** as though it were an object that could be destroyed. Alternate translation: “they are causing some people to stop believing” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 2:19
## ir1z
### ὁ & στερεὸς θεμέλιος τοῦ Θεοῦ ἕστηκεν (1)
Paul uses the image of the foundation of a building to explain that even though a false and destructive message has been destroying the faith of some people, God has nevertheless given people who want to continue to follow him a true message, which figuratively provides for them a safe and secure “place to stand.” Alternate translation: “God has provided a secure basis for people to continue to believe in him” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p058
### ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην (1)
Paul speaks figuratively of the inscription on this foundation as if it were a **seal**, since seals on the outside of documents often bore inscriptions describing their contents. Alternate translation: “having this inscription” or “which can be described in this way” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## p059
### ἔχων τὴν σφραγῖδα ταύτην (1)
Paul uses this phrase to introduce two direct quotations. The statements that follow in the rest of this verse describe two aspects of the basis that God has provided for people to continue to believe in him. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by marking these statements as quotations. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## nd7t
### ὁ ὀνομάζων τὸ ὄνομα Κυρίου (1)
The expression **names the name of the Lord** is an idiom that refers to saying the name of the Lord in order to declare that one belongs to him. Alternate translation: “who says he believes in the Lord” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## y3bc
### ἀποστήτω ἀπὸ ἀδικίας (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea behind the abstract noun **unrighteousness** with an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: “must stop doing evil things” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 2:20
## p060
### ἐν μεγάλῃ δὲ οἰκίᾳ, οὐκ ἔστιν μόνον σκεύη χρυσᾶ καὶ ἀργυρᾶ, ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα (1)
To help Timothy understand something important about following Jesus, Paul introduces the metaphor that compares the containers that are in the home of a wealthy person with people in the church. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this is a metaphor or illustration. Alternate translation: “Consider this illustration: in the home of a wealthy person, there are containers made of gold and silver, and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p061
### ἀλλὰ καὶ ξύλινα καὶ ὀστράκινα (1)
Paul leaves out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages in order to be complete. Alternate translation: “and there are also containers made of wood and clay” (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])

## j75l
### σκεύη (1)
The word **container** is a general term for items used to hold other things, such as grain, food, drink, or refuse. If your language does not have a general word, you can use a specific word such as “bowl” or “pot.”

## mt5e
### ἃ μὲν εἰς τιμὴν, ἃ δὲ εἰς ἀτιμίαν (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the ideas behind the abstract nouns **honor** and **dishonor** with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: “he uses the former at events to honor people and he uses the latter to do things that no one wants to see” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 2:21
## jm3p
### ἐκκαθάρῃ ἑαυτὸν ἀπὸ τούτων (1)
Here, Paul continues the metaphor that compares people in the church to containers in a great house that have different uses. Paul speaks figuratively of a person washing himself clean as though he had been a pot full of something bad. By this he means that the person has given up certain associations or activities. This could mean one of two things. (1) The word **these** could refer to the false teachers who are destroying the faith of some people. Alternate translation: “has disassociated himself from these false teachers” (2) The word **these** could refer to the activities of quarreling and false teaching that Paul has warned Timothy about. Alternate translation: “has stopped doing these ungodly actions” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## g79f
### ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν (1)
Paul speaks figuratively of a person who has given up these associations or activities as if he were a particular kind of container. Alternate translation: “he will be like a dish for special occasions” or “he will be like a dish that is used to honor people” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p062
### ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν (1)
The implication is that God will be able to give important assignments to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “he will be someone to whom God can give important assignments” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## mh63
### ἔσται σκεῦος εἰς τιμήν, ἡγιασμένον εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ, εἰς πᾶν ἔργον ἀγαθὸν ἡτοιμασμένον (1)
These four phrases could relate in one of two ways. (1) The ones beginning with **having been** give the reason for the phrase before them. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor because he has been sanctified, and he will be useful to the Master because he has been prepared for every good work” or (2) All four phrases could simply be describing the person. Alternate translation: “he will be a container for honor, someone who is sanctified, useful to the Master, and ready for every good work”

## p063
### ἡγιασμένον (1)
If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “whom God has set apart for himself” or “whom God has set apart for a special purpose” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## nl5d
### ἡγιασμένον (1)
If this phrase is continuing the metaphor of objects in a house, then Paul is referring to a person who is free from wrong associations or activities as if he were a precious object whose owner keeps it in a special place. Whether this phrase is continuing the metaphor or not, it still expresses the idea of being “dedicated” for a special purpose. Alternate translation: “whom God has set apart for a special purpose” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## p064
### εὔχρηστον τῷ Δεσπότῃ (1)
In the context of the metaphor of the house, Paul speaks of God figuratively as the head of the household. Alternate translation: “useful to God” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you can use an active form to express this same idea. Alternate translation: “who has gotten himself ready to do any good work” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 2:22
## h9p6
### τὰς & νεωτερικὰς ἐπιθυμίας φεῦγε (1)
Paul speaks about youthful desires as if they were a dangerous person or animal that Timothy should run away from. Alternate translation: “control your youthful desires” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])
