# Isaiah 61 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

The first part of this chapter is probably a prophecy about the coming Messiah and not Isaiah because this was different than the message Isaiah delivered. (See: [[../bible/kt/christ]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Restoration
This chapter prophesies concerning a future time of peace and restoration. It is unlikely to have been fulfilled in Isaiahâ€™s day. (See: [[../bible/kt/restore]] and [[../bible/kt/prophet]] and [[../bible/kt/fulfill]])
