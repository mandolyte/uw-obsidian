# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The “you” is plural in “you have heard” and “I say to you.” The “you” in “whoever strikes you” and the understood “you” in “turn to him” are both singular, but in some languages they may need to be plural. (See: [[figs-you]])
