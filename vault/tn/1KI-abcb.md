### Intermarriage with Gentiles
God had told the people of Israel in Mosesâ€™s law never to marry women from the Gentile nations. But Solomon married many women from Gentile countries. This was because their religious beliefs would negatively affect Israel. Solomon, the wisest man, became a fool and his wives persuaded him to worship foolish idols. God became angry and warned he would take away 10 tribes from the kingdom of his son.
