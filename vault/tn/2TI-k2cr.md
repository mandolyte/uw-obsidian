# 2 Timothy 03 General Notes

## Special concepts in this chapter

Many scholars understand the **last days** to mean the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paulâ€™s time. If so, then what Paul teaches in this chapter about being persecuted applies to all believers. But some scholars understand the **last days** to mean a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then Paul is prophesying in verses 1-9 and 13 about those days. If possible, translators should be careful not to let how they understand this issue affect how they translate these verses. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]] and [[../bible/kt/lastday]])
