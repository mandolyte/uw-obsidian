# Daniel 07 General Notes
## Structure and formatting
Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 7:9-10, 13-14, and 23-27.

## Special concepts in this chapter
### The four beasts

There will be four successive kingdoms before Yahweh sets up his eternal kingdom. (See: [[../bible/kt/eternity]])

### The Son of Man

God will give the Son of Man an eternal kingdom and he will judge people from the books. (See: [[../bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[../bible/kt/judge]])
