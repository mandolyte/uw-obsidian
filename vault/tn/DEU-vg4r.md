# Connecting Statement:

This verse describes the last three of the five things that might cause them to forget Yahweh. The first two are “you eat and are full” and “you build good houses and live in them” ([Deuteronomy 8:12](./12.md)). The last three are “when your herds and flocks multiply,” “when your silver and gold increase,” and “all that you have is multiplied.”
