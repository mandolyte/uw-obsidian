# Luke 17 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. Jesus teaches about forgiveness, faith, and service (17:1–10)

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Old Testament Examples

Jesus uses Noah and Lot’s wife as examples to teach his followers. Noah was ready for the flood when it came, and followers of Jesus need to be ready for him to return, because he will not warn them when he is about to come. Lot’s wife loved the evil city she had been living in so much that God also punished her when he destroyed it. Followers of Jesus need to love him more than anything else. You may need to provide some background information that Jesus assumed his listeners would know so that people who read your translation today can understand what Jesus is teaching here.

## Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Rhetorical Questions

Jesus asks his disciples three questions in (17:7–9) to teach them that even those who serve him well are righteous only because of his grace. (See: [[figs-rquestion]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Paradox

A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Whoever seeks to gain his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will save it” (17:33).

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### “In his day”

At the end of 17:24, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “in his day,” but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have the phrase in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.

### “There will be two in the field”

Some ancient manuscripts of the Bible include the verse 17:36, but the manuscripts considered to be the most accurate do not. ULT does not have this verse in its text, but it does have it in a footnote.

In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the verse if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
