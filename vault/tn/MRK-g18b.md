# General Information:

In verses 11 and 12, Jesus shows how the Pharisees teach people that they do not have to obey God’s commandment to honor their parents. In verse 11 Jesus tells what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions, and in verse 12 he tells how that shows the Pharisees’ attitude toward people helping their parents. This information can be reordered to first tell about the Pharisees’ attitude toward people helping their parents and then tell how that attitude is shown in what the Pharisees allow people to say about their possessions.
