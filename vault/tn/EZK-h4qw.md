# General Information:

Ezekiel seems to have been angry because Yahweh had sent him to speak to the Israelite exiles, thus rebelling against Yahweh himself. Though he was supposed to speak to them, he sat in silence for seven days, even though he could feel the anger of Yahweh “powerfully pressing on” him.
