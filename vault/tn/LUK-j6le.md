# Luke 11 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. Jesus teaches about prayer (11:1–13)
2. Jesus teaches about driving out demons and other subjects (11:14–36)
3. Jesus criticizes the Pharisees and experts in the law (11:37–54)

ULT sets the lines in 11:2-4 farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a special prayer.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### The Lord’s Prayer

When Jesus’ followers asked him to teach them how to pray, he taught them this prayer. He did not expect them to use the same words every time they prayed, but he did want them to know what God wanted them to pray about.

### Jonah

Jonah was an Old Testament prophet whom God sent to the Gentile city of Nineveh to tell the people there to repent. When he went and preached to them, they did repent. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])

### Light and darkness

The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, that is, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. The Bible speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, that is, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])

### Washing

The Pharisees would wash themselves and the things they ate with. They would even wash things that were not dirty. The law of Moses did not tell them to wash those things, but they would wash them anyway. They did that because they thought that if they obeyed both the rules that God had made and some rules that their ancestors had added, God would think that they were better people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### Bread and stone, fish and snake

In 11:11, some ancient manuscripts have a longer reading, which also is found in Matthew 7:9. It says, “Which father among you, if your son asks for a loaf of bread, will give him a stone? Or a fish, will give him a snake?” ULT uses the shorter reading, which mentions just the fish and snake. This shorter reading is well attested to in many other ancient manuscripts. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow its reading. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT.
