# 8:15
## w7nh

## hlx9
### ἐπίτρεψόν μοι πρῶτον ἀπελθεῖν καὶ θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου (1)
It is unclear whether the man’s father has died and he will bury him immediately, or if the man wants to stay for a longer amount of time until his father dies so he can bury him then. The main point is that the man wants to do something else first before he follows Jesus.

# 8:22
## h7fb
### ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς (1)
Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Possible meanings of “the dead”: (1) it is a metaphor for those who will soon die, or (2) it is a metaphor for those who do not follow Jesus and are spiritually dead.

## b2wh

## u2qh
### ποταπός ἐστιν οὗτος, ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἄνεμοι καὶ ἡ θάλασσα αὐτῷ ὑπακούουσιν (1)

## k5mk
### καὶ οἱ ἄνεμοι καὶ ἡ θάλασσα αὐτῷ ὑπακούουσιν (1)

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. Alternate translation: “I just said ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ You may think that it is harder to say ‘Get up and walk,’ because the proof of whether or not I can heal the man will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks.” or “You may think that it is easier to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’ than it is to say ‘Get up and walk.’” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])
