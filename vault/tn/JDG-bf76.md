### Sin and immorality

At the end of Judges, there is much sin and immorality. The people are doing wrong and fixing their wrongs by doing more evil things. This period of Judges is typified by this final account and summarized by the statement, “everyone did what was right in his own eyes.” (See: [[../bible/kt/sin]] and [[../bible/kt/evil]] and [[../bible/kt/righteous]])
