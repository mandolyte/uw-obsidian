# General Information:

Chapters 7 and 8 are not in chronological order. They happened while Belshazzar was still the king, before the rule of Darius and Cyrus that was discussed in chapter 6. In Danielâ€™s vision, he saw animals that were symbols of other things. Later in the vision someone explains the meaning of those symbols. (See: [[writing-symlanguage]])
