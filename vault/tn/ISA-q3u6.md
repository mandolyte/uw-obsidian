# Isaiah 62 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Restoration
This chapter prophesies concerning a future time of peace and restoration. It is unlikely to have been fulfilled in Isaiah’s day. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/restore]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])
