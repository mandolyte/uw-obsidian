# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The “you” is plural in “you have heard” and “I say to you.” The “you” and “your” are singular in “You must love your neighbor and hate your enemy,” but in some languages they may need to be plural. All occurrences of “you” and “your” after that are plural. (See: [[figs-you]])
