# Leviticus 13 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Skin disease

This chapter addresses the ways a priest was to decide if a person had a skin disease, which would make a person unclean. This was important because these diseases could have easily spread among the people in the ancient Near East. This is also true concerning things growing on clothing or things that touch a person’s skin. (See: [[../bible/kt/priest]] and [[../bible/kt/clean]])
