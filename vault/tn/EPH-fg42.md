## Special concepts in this chapter

### Predestination
Many scholars believe this chapter teaches on a subject known as “predestination.” See the use of the word “predestine” in 1:5, 11. Some scholars take this to indicate that God has, from before the foundation of the world, chosen some people to save. Christians have different views on what the Bible teaches on this subject, so translators need to take extra care when translating this chapter. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/predestine]])
