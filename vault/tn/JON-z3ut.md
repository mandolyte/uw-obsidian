# Jonah 03 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

This chapter returns to a narrative of Jonah’s life.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Animals

According to the king’s proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast he ordered. This most likely reflects their pagan mindset. There was nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have the animals participate in any religious acts. (See: [[../bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Size of Nineveh

When the author talks about the size of Nineveh, the measurements he gives are confusing. The phrase “three days’ journey” is ambiguous in Hebrew, as many scholars have remarked. In Jonah’s day, cities were not as big as they are today. So, although Nineveh was a big city, it was not as big as most modern cities.

### God repenting or relenting

The last verse of this chapter says, “So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it.” This concept of God changing His mind may seem inconsistent with the fact that God’s character and his plans do not change. But this whole book is written from a human viewpoint, and so it presents the actions of God as Jonah saw them. God had told Jonah to warn the Ninevites of judgment for their sin.

Yahweh is just, but he is also merciful. Because the Ninevites repented, God did not follow through with a judgment in this instance, and Jonah described that in a human way as “changing his mind.” The reader understands that this was God’s plan from the beginning.
