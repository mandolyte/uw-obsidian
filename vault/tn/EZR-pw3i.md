# Connecting Statement:

To this point in the letter, Artaxerxes has referred to himself in the singular, whether in the second person or the third person. But here he uses the plural. This could possibly indicate **I and my seven chief royal counselors**, as in [7:15](../07/15.md). However, since he spoke initially to these treasurers so individually and emphatically in [7:21](../07/21.md), it seems unlikely that he would appeal to supporting authorities when giving these further instructions to them. Rather, it seems that the king speaks in the plural here because he has just envisioned himself within a succession of kings who will rule over this kingdom. (As the expression **the revenue of the kings** in [4:13](../04/13.md) shows, the Persian emperors could envision their actions and decisions as embodying those of later kings.) So **we** most likely means “I,” and you could say that as an alternate translation. On the other hand, if you decide to say **we**, you should use the form that does not include the addressees, if your language makes that distinction. Alternate translation: “And I am informing you that you have no authority to collect taxes, tribute, or duty from” (See: [[figs-exclusive]])
