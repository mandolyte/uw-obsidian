### Haman plots against the Jews

Mordecai was told to prostrate himself before Haman. This would be considered to be worship. But for a Jew, it was wrong to worship someone other than Yahweh. Because of this, he refused to do it. This made Haman angry, so he decided to kill all the Jews in the Persian Empire. Haman was a descendant of Agag, a king of the Amalekite people. The Amalekites became the enemies of the Jews during the exodus (Exodus 17:8-16). Moses told the people that they would need to destroy them (Deuteronomy 25:17-19), and later God commanded Saul to destroy them (1 Samuel 15:2-3). Samuel killed King Agag (1 Samuel 15:33), but the Amalekites were never completely destroyed (1 Samuel 30:17). Both Mordecai and Haman were probably very aware that their people were enemies.
