# Luke 13 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. Jesus teaches with parables (13:1–30)
2. Jesus speaks about Herod and Jerusalem (13:31–35)

## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Unknown events

The people and Jesus speak about two events that they knew about, but about which no one today knows anything except what Luke has written. These events are Pilate executing some Galileans in the temple, 13:1–2, and 18 people being killed when a tower collapsed in Jerusalem, 13:4. In your translation, you should tell your readers no more than what Luke tells about what happened. Your translation should tell only what Luke tells.

### Paradox

A paradox is a statement that describes two things that seem as if they cannot both be true at the same time, but which actually are both true. Jesus speaks a paradox in this chapter: “Those who are least important will be first, and those who are most important will be last” (Luke 13:30)
