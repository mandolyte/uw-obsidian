# Connecting Statement:

Because believers will have a new body and have the Holy Spirit as a pledge, Paul reminds them to live by faith that they may please the Lord. He continues by reminding them to persuade others because (1) believers will appear at the judgment seat of Christ and (2) because of love for Christ who died for believers.
