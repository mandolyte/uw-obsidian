# Nehemiah 03 General Notes

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Priests
The priests worked on rebuilding the city. Normally, the priests were exempt from this type of work. Because they helped, it emphasizes that this is a holy work and something done for Yahweh. (See: [[../bible/kt/priest]] and [[../bible/kt/holy]] and [[figs-explicit]])

### Cooperation
Everyone worked on this project. Many names are mentioned to emphasize the cooperation between the different families. Each was given a section of the wall to rebuild.
