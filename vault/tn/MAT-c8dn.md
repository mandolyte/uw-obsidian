# General Information:

Jesus is talking to a group of people about what they as individuals should and should not do. The “you” is plural in “you have heard” and “I say to you.” The understood “you” is singular in “Do not commit adultery,” but in some languages it may need to be plural. (See: [[figs-you]])
