# 2 Samuel 07 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

This is the finishing of a small interruption about the house of God. (See: [[../bible/kt/houseofgod]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

David wanted to honor God by building him a temple. God told David that he would not build it, but his son would build it. (See: [[../bible/kt/temple]])

### Covenant of David
God made a covenant with David that was not conditioned upon anything David or his descendants did. God promised that one of Davidâ€™s descendants would rule Israel forever. Because Israel would not have a king in the future, this promise did not begin at this time. The descendant, who would rule forever, is Jesus. (See: [[../bible/kt/covenant]] and [[../bible/kt/promise]] and [[../bible/kt/eternity]])
