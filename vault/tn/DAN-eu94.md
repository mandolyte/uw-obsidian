# General Information:

Daniel continues to describe his vision of the court in heaven and the response to the fourth animal that he saw in [Daniel 7:7](../07/07.md). Most of the text of verses 9-14 is symbolic language with parallel lines that have similar meaning. For this reason, the ULT and UST present them in poetic form.
