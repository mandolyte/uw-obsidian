# General Information:

Since Darius addresses these men directly at the end of the sentence, we would expect him to say your **companions**, in the second person, rather than **their companions**, in the third person. So it seems that the book is compressing the letter as it quotes it. Based on the other letters that the book quotes in [4:11–16](../04/11.md), [4:17–22](../04/17.md), and [5:7–17](../05/07.md), the full letter probably said something like “To Tattenai, the governor of Beyond-the-River, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companions, the officials who are in Beyond-the-River. Peace. And now,” followed by an explanation that the court officials had discovered a scroll that recorded the decree of Cyrus. Then would follow instructions to these men, beginning “Be far away from there!” But since the quotation from this letter in the book jumps from the list of the recipients’ names right to these instructions, if it would be clearer in your language, you could use the second person throughout. Alternate translation: “Tattenai, the governor of Beyond-the-River, Shethar-Bozenai, and your associates, you officials who are in Beyond-the-River: Be far away from there” (See: [[figs-123person]])
