### Outline of the book of 2 Timothy

### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?

Paul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.

This book is the second letter Paul wrote to Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.

### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?

Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matters. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and advice about enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[translate-names]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts

### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?

As Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he spoke of being a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers have to obey to their leaders. In the same way, Christians have to obey Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.

### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?

God is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why the Bible is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about it. First, everything that the Bible teaches is free from error and can be trusted. Second, God will always preserve his Scripture for every generation of people. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### Singular and plural “you”

In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[figs-you]])

### Inclusive and exclusive “we” and “us”

In this book, “we” and “us” include the writer, Paul, the recipient, Timothy, and all believers. (See: [[figs-exclusive]])

### What did Paul mean by the expressions “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?

Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union between Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.
