2. Closing of Letter (5:13-21)

## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### “a sin towards death”

It is not entirely clear what John means by this phrase. The word “death” could refer either to physical death or to spiritual death, that is, to eternal separation from God. See the further discussion in the notes to [5:16](../05/16.md). (See: [[../bible/other/death]])

### “the whole world lies in the power of the evil one”

The phrase “the evil one” refers to Satan. God has allowed him to rule the world, but, ultimately, God is in control over everything. God keeps his children safe from the evil one. (See: [[../bible/kt/satan]])

## Important textual issues in this chapter

In [5:7–8](../05/07.md), all ancient manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify, the Spirit and the water and the blood, and the three are unto the one.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some much later manuscripts say: “For there are three who testify in heaven: the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one; and there are three who testify on earth: the Spirit and the water and the blood, and these three are unto the one.” In this case, translators are advised to translate this as the ULT text does, since there is wide agreement that it follows the accurate reading. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that have the longer reading, you can include it, but you should put it inside square brackets [ ] to indicate that it was most likely not in the original version of 1 John.
