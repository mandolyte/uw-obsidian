# Jonah 04 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

Jonah continues the narrative while bringing the book to what seems like an unusual end. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God’s desire to be merciful to everyone, whether Jew or pagan. (See: [[../bible/kt/mercy]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Prophecy not coming true

It is important to see the relationship between a prophet and Yahweh. A prophet was to prophesy for Yahweh, and his words must come true. According to the law of Moses, if that did not happen, the penalty was death, because that shows that he was not a real prophet. But when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in forty days, it did not happen at that time. This is because God reserves the right to be merciful. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]] and [[../bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

## Jonah’s anger

When God did not destroy Nineveh, Jonah was angry with God because Jonah hated the people of Nineveh. They were enemies of Israel. But God wanted Jonah, and the readers of this book, to learn that God loves all people.

### Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Rhetorical questions

As in other places, Jonah asks rhetorical questions to show how angry he was at Yahweh. (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

### Parallel to Mount Sinai

In verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as a formula Moses used in speaking about God when he was meeting God on Mount Sinai. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### God’s grace

When Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot and God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah through an object lesson. It is important for the reader to see this clearly. (See: [[../bible/kt/grace]])
