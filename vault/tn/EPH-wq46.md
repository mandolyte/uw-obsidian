# General Information:

The command in verse one is plural. Then in verses two and three Paul quotes from the law of Moses. Moses was talking to the people of Israel as though they were one person, so **your** and **you** are singular there. If that does not make sense, you may need to translate them as plurals. (See: [[figs-you]])
