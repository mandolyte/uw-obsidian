## Structure and formatting

Paul formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Spiritual children
In this chapter, Paul calls Timothy a “son” and his “child.” Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader. Paul may also have led him to believe in Christ. Therefore, Paul called Timothy his “son in the faith.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]] and [[figs-metaphor]])

### Metaphor

In this chapter Paul speaks figuratively of people who are not fulfilling the purpose of their faith as if they had “missed the mark” that they were aiming at, as if they had “turned away” down a wrong path, and as if they had been “shipwrecked.” He speaks figuratively of following Jesus faithfully as “fighting the good fight.”
