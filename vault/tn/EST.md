### וַ⁠יְהִ֖י (1)
In the Old Testament, this is a standard way of beginning a historical story. Many languages have similar story-opening formulas, and if your language has one, you can use it. But do not use it if it would suggest that the story is not real, only made up. Alternate translation: “this account happened” (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## zzz2
### בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ (1)
The term **day** is used figuratively here to refer to a longer period of time. You could just say “during the reign of Ahasuerus,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “in the time of Ahasuerus” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## qwe1
### אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ (1)
This is a man’s name. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[translate-names]])

## v5ts
### ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙ מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה (1)
This is background information to help the reader identify Ahasuerus. (See: [[writing-background]])

## qwe3
### ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙ (1)
Alternative translation: “This king named Ahasuerus ruled”

## qwe5
### מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ (1)
In case your audience might not know where these places are, you could say, “extending from India in the east to Ethiopia in the west.” (See: [[writing-background]])

## qwe7
### שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה (1)
The number is given to show what a large empire this was. You could say that explicitly by saying, “Ahasuerus ruled a very large empire that had 127 provinces.” (See: [[writing-background]])

## qwe8
### שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה (1)
Alternate translation: “one hundred twenty-seven provinces” (See: [[translate-numbers]])

# 1:2
## dk31
### כְּ⁠שֶׁ֣בֶת & עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ (1)
Here, the action of **sitting** on a throne is used figuratively to mean ruling over a kingdom. You could just say “ruled,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “ruled his empire from his royal throne” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## qwe9
### עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ (1)
**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with a verb by saying, “the throne he ruled from,” or use an adjective, “his royal throne.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## hgm3
### בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן (1)
This was the name of a royal city of the Persian kings. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[translate-names]])

## qwr1
### הַ⁠בִּירָֽה (1)
This means a castle or palace where a king would live. But since the city of Susa itself is being called a **citadel** here, it’s likely that the term figuratively means royal city or capital city. The person telling this story is identifying Susa as the capital by calling it by the name of something closely associated with it, the royal palace within it. A good translation might be “the capital city of Persia.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

# 1:3
## ry7m
### בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ (1)
This means that Ahasuerus had already ruled for two full years and that these events took place in the year that followed them. Alternate translation: “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled his empire” or “after he had ruled for two years” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

## qwr3
### בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ (1)
**Reign** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate it with a verb by saying, “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

Alternative translation: “he hosted a feast”

## prm1

## qwr7
### הַֽ⁠פַּרְתְּמִ֛ים (1)
This probably means something like “the wealthy landowners.”

## jdr3
### לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו (1)
**Face** figuratively stands for the presence of a person, so this phrase means “in his presence.” The invitation was to come to the royal capital to attend a banquet where the king would be present in person. You could say, as UST does, that the king was present in person to host the feast. Or you could say as an alternative, “all of them came to Susa for the feast” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 1:4
## qwr9
### בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ אֶת־עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ (1)
You can translate the abstract noun with an emphasized adjective. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus … wanted to demonstrate … the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## qet1
### בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ (1)
**He** refers to the king. The implication is that he held this banquet to show all of his officials how wealthy and powerful he was. The invited officials would then go back to all the different parts of the empire and tell everyone this. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus wanted to demonstrate to his guests” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## m8xa
### עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ (1)
The words **wealth** and **glory** have similar meanings and they are used together to emphasize how great his kingdom was. Alternate translation: “the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## qet3
### בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ & וְ⁠אֶ֨ת־יְקָ֔ר תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת גְּדוּלָּת֑⁠וֹ (1)
You can translate the abstract nouns **splendor**, **beauty**, and **greatness** as adjectives. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus … wanted to demonstrate … that he was a very powerful king” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## lun5
### יְקָ֔ר תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת גְּדוּלָּת֑⁠וֹ (1)
The words **splendor** and **beauty** have similar meaning and emphasize how great he was. Alternate translation: “the splendor of his greatness” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## qet5
### יָמִ֣ים רַבִּ֔ים שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם (1)
This was a very long time for a royal feast to last. The earlier part of the verse provides the reason for this. To make the connection explicit, you could add some explanatory words to the verse like this: “Ahasuerus entertained his guests fabulously because he wanted to demonstrate that his empire was extremely wealthy and that he was a very powerful king. He did so many things for them that the festivities lasted for six months.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## x1v6
### שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם (1)
Six months is about **180 days** or about half a year. You can use whatever expression will best express this time period in your language. (See: [[translate-numbers]])

# 1:5
## ue3x
### וּ⁠בִ⁠מְל֣וֹאת ׀ הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה (1)
This implies “at the end of that feast.” You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after those 180 days were over” or “at the end of those six months” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## fv9y
### עָשָׂ֣ה הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ & מִשְׁתֶּ֖ה (1)
This was a second feast that the king hosted. He likely did this to thank the people who had worked so hard in hosting the first feast. You could say that explicitly. (See: [[translate-numbers]])

## mj16
### בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֨ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֜ה (1)
The expression in this case seems to refer specifically to the royal **citadel** from which the city got its name. This second feast would not have been for everyone in the entire city. It was specifically for the people who served the king in the citadel and who had worked so hard over the previous six months hosting the first feast. Alternate translation: “for every man who worked for him in the palace at Susa” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qet7
### הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩ (1)
Here, **found** is an idiom that means could be found or were there. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## qet9
### הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩ (1)

## qey1
### לְ⁠מִ⁠גָּ֧דוֹל וְ⁠עַד־קָטָ֛ן (1)
The person telling this story is referring to the staff of the palace by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the most important and the least important people who worked there, in order to include everyone in between. You could just explain this meaning, as UST does. Alternate translation: “from the most important official to the least important servant” (See: [[figs-merism]])

## qey3
### שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֑ים (1)
Alternate translation: “another feast that lasted seven days” The story does not suggest that this was an unusually long time by saying, “for many days.” But you could also say something like “a whole week” to show that this was a generous gesture of thanks on the part of the king.

# 1:6
## qey5
### ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת (1)
These **linens** were curtains that were hung in the courtyard. **Cotton** refers to the white color of some of them. So this means white and blue curtains. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qey7
### ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת (1)
You can specify at the beginning of this verse that the location being described is the same as in the previous verse: “In the courtyard, white and blue curtains.”

## qey9
### בְּ⁠חַבְלֵי־ב֣וּץ וְ⁠אַרְגָּמָ֔ן (1)
**Byssus** means “white linen” and it is used to describe the white color of some of these cords. So this means white and purple cords. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qru1
### מִטּ֣וֹת ׀ זָהָ֣ב וָ⁠כֶ֗סֶף (1)
You can specify that these couches were there for the guests to recline on while they ate. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## asn4

This word probably refers to a mosaic floor made of inlaid pieces of colorful precious stones.
(See: [[translate-unknown]])

## eyi2
### בַּהַט (1)
This is a kind of red and purple stone that contains pieces of crystal. You could call it “feldspar” or something descriptive like “red marble.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qru3
### וָ⁠שֵׁ֖שׁ (1)
This is a white precious stone. You could identify it as “alabaster.” Alternatively, while it is not exactly the same thing as marble, your readers would get the right idea if you called it “white marble.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qru5
### וְ⁠סֹחָֽרֶת (1)
This word probably refers to a black marble that was used to create borders around mosaics. You could call this “black marble,” or you could just say that the floor contained “another precious stone.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

# 1:7
## urm7
### וְ⁠הַשְׁקוֹת֙ (1)
The abstract noun **serving** refers to how the drinks were served at the banquet. You can translate it with a verb by saying, “The attendants served wine.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## qru7
### וְ⁠כֵלִ֖ים מִ⁠כֵּלִ֣ים שׁוֹנִ֑ים (1)
This could mean that “no two of them were alike.” But you could also just say that the wine was served in “various kinds of golden cups.”

## r6ec
### וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
This means that King Ahasuerus himself paid for all the wine that the guests drank at his seven-day feast in Susa, and the wine came from his personal supply. Alternate translation: “the king was very generous with the royal wine” or “the king showed a great willingness to give” or “the king provided all of it” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## qru9
### וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
This probably means special fine wine that only the king could acquire and afford. You can translate the abstract noun **royalty** with an adjective. Alternate translation: “royal wine” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## wpq1
### כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Here, **hand** refers figuratively to the king himself, viewed through his action of giving. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 1:8
## qtu1
### וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁתִיָּ֥ה כַ⁠דָּ֖ת (1)
The abstract noun **drinking** refers here not to the action of drinking, but to the guidelines for serving drinks that the king had established for the banquet. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus had established this rule for all his household attendants who served the wine” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## g5gu
### אֵ֣ין אֹנֵ֑ס (1)
This could mean one of two things: (1) No one would be stopped from drinking even if the attendants thought they had already had enough. Alternate translation: “there was to be no restriction on drinking” (2) There would be no requirement to drink. Alternate translation: “no one must be forced to drink” Either way, this was another sign of the generosity that the king showed as he hosted this banquet to thank the people who worked for him. Either he was: (1) allowing them to drink as much as they wanted to, or (2) not requiring them to eat and drink everything that was served at a banquet as guests of the king would usually be expected to do. You could say explicitly at the beginning of the verse that the king was giving his guests a special privilege. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## f6px
### כִּי־כֵ֣ן ׀ יִסַּ֣ד הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ עַ֚ל כָּל־רַ֣ב בֵּית֔⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ (1)
Alternate translation: “the king made the attendants who served the wine follow this rule” This explains why no one had to drink if they did not want to. If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so.” You could say, “The king had established for every overseer of his house to do according to the desire of man by man, so the drinking was according to the law, ‘There is no compulsion.’” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## qtu3
### לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ (1)

# 1:9

### וַשְׁתִּ֣י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה (1)

These are names of seven men. (See: [[translate-names]])

## ens5
### הַ⁠סָּ֣רִיסִ֔ים (1)
This term occurs a dozen times in the story. It describes male royal officials who served as guardians for the women who lived in the palace. They were both guardians of the door, to keep unwanted people out of the women’s quarters, and guardians of the women inside, to take care of them and look after their needs. (As we learn in 2:21, some of these officials also protected the king’s private quarters.) As we see here, and as will also be seen in 2:14 and 2:16, their duties included escorting women from place to place. The term likely indicates that, in keeping with the practices of the time, these men were castrated because their work brought them into such close contact with the king’s wives and concubines. If your language has a term for such an official and you think your readers would recognize it, you can use it. Otherwise, you can use a term that describes the role that these officials played in the royal court. Alternate translation: “guardians” or “officials” or “castrated servants” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## qti7
### הַ⁠מְשָׁ֣רְתִ֔ים אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ (1)

# 1:11
## qti9
### לְ֠⁠הָבִיא (1)

## asd3
### בְּ⁠כֶ֣תֶר מַלְכ֑וּת (1)
Ahasuerus likely wanted Vashti to wear her queen’s crown so that everyone would know that she was his wife. You could say that explicitly. (For the possible reasons why he wanted them to know this, see the next note.) (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## asd5
### לְ⁠הַרְא֨וֹת הָֽ⁠עַמִּ֤ים וְ⁠הַ⁠שָּׂרִים֙ אֶת־יָפְיָ֔⁠הּ (1)
Everything Ahasuerus did at his banquets was to show how rich and powerful he was. He seems to have believed that having a very beautiful wife was one more thing that proved he was a great man. So he wanted everyone to see how beautiful Vashti was. You can put this second in the verse, after explaining that Vashti was a very beautiful woman, because it accounts for what happens afterwards, when the king sends his seven personal servants to bring her in to his banquet. (See: [[writing-background]])

## asd7
### הָֽ⁠עַמִּ֤ים וְ⁠הַ⁠שָּׂרִים֙ (1)
This might mean “his guests, especially the officials.”

## asd9
### כִּֽי־טוֹבַ֥ת מַרְאֶ֖ה הִֽיא (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you can place this first in the verse because it is the reason that explains everything else that happens afterward in the verse. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## qvk4
### כִּֽי־טוֹבַ֥ת מַרְאֶ֖ה הִֽיא (1)
Alternate translation: “she was very beautiful” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 1:12
## asf1
### וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֞ן הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֣ה וַשְׁתִּ֗י לָ⁠בוֹא֙ (1)
You can put the events in chronological order and say first that the eunuchs told Vashti what the king had commanded and then say that she refused to come**.** (See: [[figs-events]])

## asf3
### וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֞ן הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֣ה וַשְׁתִּ֗י לָ⁠בוֹא֙ (1)
If your language needs to give a reason why she refused, it is most likely because she did not want a group of drunken men staring at her lustfully. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## b57q

## bsd5
### וַ⁠חֲמָת֖⁠וֹ בָּעֲרָ֥ה בֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Here the story uses a metaphor that pictures the king’s anger as **a fire that burned inside of him**. If your language has a different word picture that it uses to describe extreme anger, you can use that here. If not, you can translate plainly, “his anger continued to increase.” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 1:13
## asf9
### לַ⁠חֲכָמִ֖ים (1)

## adg5
### הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ (1)
Memukan speaks of **the king** in third person as a form of respect. If you want to portray him as speaking primarily to the king because he is answering the king’s question, you could have him say, “in all the provinces that you rule” or “every person who lives in your entire empire.” (See: [[figs-123person]])

# 1:17
## jd17
### כִּֽי (1)

## gn4g
### יֵצֵ֤א דְבַר־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּה֙ עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים (1)
To emphasize his point, Memukan exaggerates and says that every single woman in the empire will hear about Queen Vashti refusing to obey King Ahasuerus. You could say, as UST does, that “women all over the empire” will hear about what the queen did. Or you could preserve Memukan’s manner of speaking by saying, “every woman” will hear.

The implication is that they will go on to say, “So if even the queen can disobey the king, why should I have to obey my husband?” If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## adg9
### הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֡וֹשׁ אָמַ֞ר לְ⁠הָבִ֨יא אֶת־וַשְׁתִּ֧י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠לֹא־בָֽאָה (1)

### לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו (1)

did to Vashti.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

### שׁוּשַׁ֥ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֖ה (1)
Here again, this likely means “the capital city of Susa.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## mbk1
### אֶל־יַ֣ד הֵגָ֑י (1)
Here, **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. As the overseer of the women, Hegai was responsible for the women in the harem for virgins. You could say that the officers “put them under the custody of Hegai” or that “Hegai began to take care of them.” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## zcv9
### וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בְּ⁠הִשָּׁמַ֤ע & וּֽ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֞ץ & וַ⁠תִּלָּקַ֤ח (1)
This means that Esther was brought to the harem of King Ahaserus at the same time as other young women were also being brought to the harem. You can say, “they brought Esther at the same time” or “they also brought Esther.” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])

As earlier in this verse, this means under the custody of Hegai or that Hegai also began to take care of her. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## zcb5
### שֹׁמֵ֥ר הַ⁠נָּשִֽׁים (1)
This means that Hegai took care of the young women who lived in the harem for virgins. If it would be clearer in your language, you could move this information to earlier in the verse when Hegai is first mentioned because it explains why the young women were brought to him. (See: [[writing-background]])

# 2:9
## zcb7
### וַ⁠תִּיטַ֨ב הַ⁠נַּעֲרָ֣ה בְ⁠עֵינָי⁠ו֮ וַ⁠תִּשָּׂ֣א חֶ֣סֶד לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֒ (1)
This means that Hegai found Esther attractive, and she obtained kindness from him or that Hegai was very impressed with Esther, and she won his favor. In other words, because he was so impressed with her, this made him want to do everything he could to help her. This is background information that explains why Hegai took the actions that are listed next.

## zcb9
### וַ⁠תִּיטַ֨ב הַ⁠נַּעֲרָ֣ה בְ⁠עֵינָי⁠ו֮ (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. In this context, the phrase probably means that Hegai thought that Esther was either an attractive woman or a pleasant person, or both. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## f8i8
### הַ⁠נַּעֲרָ֣ה (1)
This means Esther. You should make sure that this is clear in your translation.

## jd75
### בְ⁠עֵינָי⁠ו֮ (1)
Here, **his** refers to Hegai. You should make sure that this clear in your translation.

## jd77
### וַ⁠תִּשָּׂ֣א חֶ֣סֶד לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֒ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. To say that she “lifted kindness before his face” is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. In this context, it could even suggest that Esther and Hegai became friends. Alternate translation: “she won his favor” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## jd79
### לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֒ (1)
Here, **his** refers to Hegai. You should make sure that this clear in your translation.

## abc1
### תַּמְרוּקֶ֤י⁠הָ (1)
Alternate translation: “her beauty treatments,” as in [2:3](../02/03.md). (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abc2
### מָנוֹתֶ֨⁠הָ֙ (1)
In context, this likely means that Hegai made sure that Esther was served good food that would keep her healthy.

## abc3
### שֶׁ֣בַע הַ⁠נְּעָר֔וֹת הָ⁠רְאֻי֥וֹת לָֽ⁠תֶת־לָ֖⁠הּ מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
This means that Hegai chose seven female servants from the king’s palace and assigned them to take care of Esther.

## abc4
### וַ⁠יְשַׁנֶּ֧⁠הָ וְ⁠אֶת־נַעֲרוֹתֶ֛י⁠הָ (1)
**Her** means Esther, and **her young women** means the female attendants Hegai assigned to her.

# 2:10
## abc6
### לֹא־הִגִּ֣ידָה אֶסְתֵּ֔ר אֶת־עַמָּ֖⁠הּ וְ⁠אֶת־מֽוֹלַדְתָּ֑⁠הּ (1)
This means that Esther had not told anyone this information about herself.

## abc7
### אֶת־עַמָּ֖⁠הּ וְ⁠אֶת־מֽוֹלַדְתָּ֑⁠הּ (1)
These two short phrases mean almost the same thing. They are used together to emphasize that Esther followed Mordecai’s instructions exactly. You could combine them, as UST does, and say something like “what people group she was from.” Alternate translation: “Esther did not tell anyone that she was a Jew, and she did not tell anyone who her relatives were” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## abc8
### כִּ֧י מָרְדֳּכַ֛י צִוָּ֥ה עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ (1)
This is background information that explains why Esther did not tell anyone about her family or nationality. So you can say this first in the verse if that is clearer in your language. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## abc9
### צִוָּ֥ה עָלֶ֖י⁠הָ (1)
This means that Mordecai had gotten her to promise not to do it.

# 2:11
## jd81
### וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־י֣וֹם וָ⁠י֔וֹם (1)
Alternate translation: “every single day” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abd1
### מָרְדֳּכַי֙ מִתְהַלֵּ֔ךְ (1)
Express this in the way your language describes an action that someone repeats over and over. For example, you can say, “Mordecai would walk around.”

## jd83
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י חֲצַ֣ר (1)
Here, **face** figuratively means the front of a place. So you could say, “in front of the courtyard.” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abd2
### בֵּית־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים (1)
Alternate translation: “the harem for virgins”

## abd3
### לָ⁠דַ֨עַת֙ אֶת־שְׁל֣וֹם אֶסְתֵּ֔ר וּ⁠מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה בָּֽ⁠הּ (1)
This is background information that explains why Mordecai would walk around in front of the courtyard. It was so that he could ask people who were going into or coming out of the courtyard how Esther was doing. You can place this first in the verse because it explains the rest of what is said, if that would be clearer in your language. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## nz1p
### שְׁל֣וֹם אֶסְתֵּ֔ר (1)
Alternate translation: “how Esther was doing” or “about Esther’s well-being”

## abd4
### שְׁל֣וֹם אֶסְתֵּ֔ר וּ⁠מַה־יֵּעָשֶׂ֖ה בָּֽ⁠הּ (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. The story is using the repetition to emphasize how concerned Mordecai was for Esther. You could combine them and say, “how Esther was doing” or “if Esther was all right.”
(See: [[figs-parallelism]])

# 2:12
## jcj8
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הַגִּ֡יעַ (1)
Verses 12 to 14 are background information about how the virgins who were gathered for the king became his concubines. These verses are not specifically about Esther, but about the women in general. Use your language’s way of letting your readers know that this is background information by using a connecting word or a phrase such as, “This is how virgins became concubines for the king.” (See: [[writing-background]])

## jd85
### נַעֲרָ֨ה וְ⁠נַעֲרָ֜ה (1)
Alternate translation: “each one of the young women” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abd5
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הַגִּ֡יעַ תֹּר֩ & לָ⁠ב֣וֹא ׀ אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ (1)
Each of these young women was going to have sexual relations with the king and, as a result, legally become one of his concubines, that is, one of his secondary wives. As the story has already explained, he would then choose one of them to become his queen and primary wife. But the king would still provide for each of the concubines for the rest of her life; they would not be free to marry anyone else. This is something that the story’s original audience would have understood implicitly. You can say it explicitly if your readers need this information to understand the story: “Each young woman in the harem, one at a time, was going to have sexual relations with King Ahasuerus and become one of his concubines” or “one of his secondary wives.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## p7i5
### כְּ⁠דָ֤ת הַ⁠נָּשִׁים֙ (1)
Here, **law** probably does not mean a legal decree, but rather a standard regimen that had been developed. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abd7
### כִּ֛י כֵּ֥ן יִמְלְא֖וּ יְמֵ֣י מְרוּקֵי⁠הֶ֑ן (1)
This phrase indicates that the story is now going to provide background information on how these treatments were done. It means, “This is how these women would spend the time preparing to go to the king.” (See: [[writing-background]])

## abd8
### שִׁשָּׁ֤ה חֳדָשִׁים֙ בְּ⁠שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מֹּ֔ר (1)
This means that a woman’s attendants would rub her body with olive oil mixed with myrrh every day for six months. You can explain this in more detail if your readers need this information to understand the story. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abd9
### בְּ⁠שֶׁ֣מֶן הַ⁠מֹּ֔ר (1)
This likely means “olive oil mixed with myrrh.”

## zhd1
### וּ⁠בְ⁠תַמְרוּקֵ֖י הַ⁠נָּשִֽׁים (1)
This means lotions designed for women. In 2:3 and 2:9, this one specific part of the program seems to be used figuratively to mean all of it, and so in those verses it can be translated “beauty treatments.” But it should be translated with a specific term or phrase here, such as “women’s lotions” or “feminine ointments” because it is named along with oils and perfumes as one component of the treatment. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

# 2:13
## abd0
### וּ⁠בָ⁠זֶ֕ה (1)
Alternate translation: “after a woman’s year of beauty treatments was completed”

## abe0
### הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֖ה בָּאָ֣ה אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
This means that the young woman would go and have sexual relations with the king and thereby become one of his concubines. If your readers need this information to understand the story, you could explain that here, if you did not do so in verse 12. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abe1
### כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֜ר יִנָּ֤תֵֽן לָ⁠הּ֙ (1)
**Anything** most likely refers to clothing and jewelry. This phrase probably means that a woman could take any of those that she wanted from the harem for virgins and wear them when she went to the king’s palace. You could say that explicitly by saying, “A young woman could take whatever clothing and jewelry she wanted from the harem for virgins and wear them when she went to the king’s palace.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## v133
### כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֨ר תֹּאמַ֜ר יִנָּ֤תֵֽן לָ⁠הּ֙ (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “she could take whatever she wanted” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abe3
### בֵּ֥ית הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Alternate translation: “the king’s rooms” or “the king’s house” or “the king’s palace”

# 2:14
## abe4
### הִ֣יא בָאָ֗ה (1)
She would not walk over on her own. Rather, the king’s servants would come and bring her to the king’s private quarters, in the way that they were told to bring Vashti to the banquet in [1:11](../01/11.md). You can say this explicitly if it would help your readers to understand the story. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## ded5
### וּ֠⁠בַ⁠בֹּקֶר הִ֣יא שָׁבָ֞ה (1)
It is implied that this is the following morning. This information can be made clear. Once again, she would not go on her own. Alternate translation: “the next morning the king’s servants would bring her to” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## lq9h
### בֵּ֤ית הַ⁠נָּשִׁים֙ שֵׁנִ֔י (1)

## ze74
### אֶל־יַ֧ד שַֽׁעֲשְׁגַ֛ז סְרִ֥יס הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שֹׁמֵ֣ר הַ⁠פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים (1)
Here, **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. Just as Hegai was the overseer of the virgins, Shaashgaz was the overseer of the concubines, so he would be the one responsible for Esther while she was in the harem for concubines. Alternate translation: “under the custody of Shaashgaz” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## q5yx
### שַֽׁעֲשְׁגַ֛ז (1)
This is a man’s name. (See: [[translate-names]])

## abe5
### סְרִ֥יס הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ (1)
See how you translated this term, **eunuch**, in [1:10](../01/10.md). You could say “royal” rather than “of the king.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abe6
### שֹׁמֵ֣ר הַ⁠פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים (1)
This means that Shaashgaz was the official who *took care of the concubines* or who was responsible for the concubines.

## abe7
### הַ⁠פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים (1)
As a **concubine**, the young woman was one of the king’s secondary wives. She would live in this harem for the rest of her life. She was not free to return to her family or to marry anybody else. If it would help your readers to understand the story, you could explain all or part of this to your readers here, if you did not do so in 2:12 or 2:13. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abe8
### לֹא־תָב֥וֹא עוֹד֙ אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Alternate translation: “She would not go and see the king again.” In verse 12, the Note mentioned that “go to the king” meant “have sexual relations with the king.” But for this occurrence of the expression, it is appropriate to use a more general phrase such as “visit the king” because there could be other, more social reasons for a further visit. The woman would now be a secondary wife, and the king would only send for her if he decided that he enjoyed being with her.

## abe9
### חָפֵ֥ץ בָּ֛⁠הּ (1)
This means that he “had enjoyed being with her” or that she “had pleased the king very much.”

## abf0
### וְ⁠נִקְרְאָ֥ה בְ⁠שֵֽׁם (1)
You can say this with an active form. For example, you can say, “and the king asked for her by name” or “and called for her by name.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 2:15
## fiy8
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הַגִּ֣יעַ תֹּר־אֶסְתֵּ֣ר & לָ⁠ב֣וֹא אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)
The story resumes here after the background information that was provided in verses 12-14 about what the women in the harem did when they became concubines of the king. A contrast is being drawn. A young woman could take any clothing and jewelry she wanted from the harem. But Esther only asked for what Hegai recommended. So it would be good to introduce this episode with a word such as “but,” which draws a contrast. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## jk51
### בַּת־אֲבִיחַ֣יִל דֹּ֣ד מָרְדֳּכַ֡י אֲשֶׁר֩ לָקַֽח־ל֨⁠וֹ לְ⁠בַ֜ת (1)
This background information reminds the reader who Esther was by describing her relationship to Mordecai. You could make this a separate sentence and move it later in the verse to keep from breaking up the flow of the first sentence about what Esther did. (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

## mg8y
### אֲבִיחַ֣יִל (1)
This man was Esther’s father and Mordecai’s uncle. (See: [[translate-names]])

## qx3u
### לֹ֤א בִקְשָׁה֙ דָּבָ֔ר כִּ֠י אִ֣ם אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹאמַ֛ר הֵגַ֥י (1)
You can state this in a positive form by saying, “she asked only for.” Alternate translation: “she did not ask for anything else to wear except” (See: [[figs-doublenegatives]])

## vw9r
### אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹאמַ֛ר הֵגַ֥י (1)
Alternate translation: “what Hegai recommended” or “what Hegai suggested”

## abf1
### אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֹאמַ֛ר הֵגַ֥י (1)
As the king’s personal servant, **Hegai** would have known what kind of clothing and jewelry Ahasuerus found attractive on a woman. By following his advice, Esther showed that she trusted Hegai. This is implicit information that you can make explicit if it would help the reader to understand the story. You might say, for example, “Hegai knew the king’s preferences because he was his personal servant. Esther had come to trust Hegai and so she followed his advice.” This could go at the end of the verse or in a footnote. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abf2
### סְרִיס־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שֹׁמֵ֣ר הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים (1)
This is saying that Hegai was the royal official responsible for the women in the harem for virgins. This is background information that reminds the reader who Hegai was by describing his responsibilities. You could also move this to the end of the verse and put it in parentheses. (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

## abf3
### סְרִיס־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ (1)
See how you decided to translate the term **eunuch** in [1:10](../01/10.md). You could say “royal” for “of the king.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## z519
### נֹשֵׂ֣את חֵ֔ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י כָּל־רֹאֶֽי⁠הָ (1)
This is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. In this context, the expression probably means that everyone who saw Esther dressed in the clothes she would wear for her visit to the king was very impressed with the way she looked. Alternate translation: “pleased all who saw her” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## jd87
### בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י (1)
Here, **eyes** is a metonym for seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. In this context, the phrase probably means that everyone who saw Esther thought that she was either an attractive woman or a pleasant person, or both. Alternate translation: “in the judgment of” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## jd89
### כָּל־רֹאֶֽי⁠הָ (1)
This phrase can mean either **every man or every person who saw her**. Alternate translation: “every man who saw her” (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

# 2:16
## jd91
### וַ⁠תִּלָּקַ֨ח אֶסְתֵּ֜ר (1)
You can say this with an active form by saying, for example, “The king’s servants brought Esther.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abf5
### אֶל־בֵּ֣ית מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ (1)
You can use an adjective to translate the abstract noun **royalty.** For example, you can say, “in his royal palace” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## jd92
### בַּ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ הָ⁠עֲשִׂירִ֖י (1)
Alternate translation: “in month ten” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

## jr5s
### הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת (1)
**Tebeth** is the name of the tenth month of the Hebrew calendar. Alternate translation: “that is, the month of Tebeth” (See: [[translate-hebrewmonths]])

## abf6
### חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת (1)
The story is being recorded from the perspective of the Persian court. But for the benefit of its intended Jewish audience, the Hebrew name of the month is given.

## abf7
### חֹ֣דֶשׁ טֵבֵ֑ת (1)
You could convert the Hebrew days and months into approximate dates on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to provide the Hebrew days and months. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## x6yg
### בִּ⁠שְׁנַת־שֶׁ֖בַע לְ⁠מַלְכוּתֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Alternate translation: “during the seventh year of the reign of Ahasuerus as king of Persia” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

### וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֨ב הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֶת־אֶסְתֵּר֙ מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים וַ⁠תִּשָּׂא־חֵ֥ן וָ⁠חֶ֛סֶד לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠בְּתוּלֹ֑ת (1)
These two phrases mean almost the same thing. The information is given twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that Ahasuerus was completely convinced that Esther was the one he should make his queen**.** “More than all the virgins” basically duplicates the meaning of “more than all the women,” so, if this duplication would be confusing in your language, you don’t need to include both phrases, or you could say, “more than all of them” for the second phrase. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## abf8
### מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים (1)
This means all the other women who had been brought to the king and who became his concubines. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## bcu8
### וַ⁠תִּשָּׂא־חֵ֥ן וָ⁠חֶ֛סֶד לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו (1)
This is a rare expression in Hebrew, and the exact meaning is uncertain. See how you translated similar phrases in [2:9](../02/09.md) and [2:15](../02/15.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus was very impressed with both Esther’s appearance and her personality. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abf9
### וַ⁠תִּשָּׂא־חֵ֥ן וָ⁠חֶ֛סֶד לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו (1)
**Favor** and **kindness** mean similar things and are probably used together here to strengthen a single idea. Alternate translation: “he was very pleased with her” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## jd93
### לְ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## sym3
### וַ⁠יָּ֤שֶׂם כֶּֽתֶר־מַלְכוּת֙ בְּ⁠רֹאשָׁ֔⁠הּ (1)
Ahasuerus did this to show that he was making Esther his queen. (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abg0
### כֶּֽתֶר־מַלְכוּת֙ (1)
To translate the abstract noun **royalty**, you can use an adjective such as a “royal” crown. (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 2:18
## abg1
### וַ⁠יַּ֨עַשׂ הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ מִשְׁתֶּ֣ה גָד֗וֹל (1)
The king did this to celebrate Esther becoming the queen. You can say this explicitly. For example, you can say, “Then, to celebrate her becoming the queen, the king hosted a great feast.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## b1hd
### מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה אֶסְתֵּ֑ר (1)
You could indicate to your readers this is the name that Ahasuerus gave to the feast, for example, “He called it ‘Esther’s Feast.’” (See: [[translate-names]])

## ufm8
### וַ⁠הֲנָחָ֤ה לַ⁠מְּדִינוֹת֙ עָשָׂ֔ה (1)
This was probably a “tax holiday,” that is, a temporary elimination of taxes. For a time, the provinces did not have to send in the usual taxes to the king. You could say something like “he proclaimed a temporary reprieve from taxes for all the provinces of his empire.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## jd95
### כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Here, **hand** figuratively represents the action of doing or giving. The phrase means that King Ahasuerus personally gave lavish gifts to the guests at this feast. You could say something like “with royal generosity” or “with great willingness to give” or “with generosity that only a king can give.” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 2:19
## g38f
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית (1)
Since this happened some time after Esther’s Feast, you can show this by using a connecting phrase such as “some time later.” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

## p842
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית (1)
The most likely explanation for this is that Ahasuerus decided he would like to have more concubines. You can say this explicitly if it will help the readers to understand the story. He probably believed that having a large number of concubines was another thing that would show he was a great king. To do so, you could add: “because Ahasuerus decided that he would like to have more concubines.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abg2
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. For example, you can say, “at the time when the king’s officers were gathering virgins for a second time.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## ang3
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הִקָּבֵ֥ץ בְּתוּל֖וֹת שֵׁנִ֑ית וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֖י (1)

## a23f
### וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֖י יֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Possible meanings are: (1) **Sitting at the king’s gate** is an idiom meaning that Mordecai worked for the king in some capacity and was stationed at the gate. (See: [[figs-idiom]]) (2) Mordecai sat there so he could hear about how Esther was doing from the many people who passed through the gate.

## i8in
### בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)

### מֽוֹלַדְתָּ⁠הּ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־עַמָּ֔⁠הּ (1)

### וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֖י יֹשֵׁ֣ב בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
It is implicit in the story that Mordecai heard the two men talking who are named right afterwards. You can say this explicitly if it helps the readers to understand this part of the story. To do so, add: “he heard two men talking.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abg8
### יֹשֵׁ֣ב בְּ⁠שַֽׁעַר־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)

## abh0
### מִ⁠שֹּׁמְרֵ֣י הַ⁠סַּ֔ף (1)

## abh4
### וַ⁠יִּתָּל֥וּ שְׁנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם עַל־עֵ֑ץ (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the king ordered his servants to impale those two men on wooden poles” or “the king ordered his servants to hang those two men on a gallows” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## y28j
### עַל־עֵ֑ץ (1)
Here, **tree** could mean a live tree or anything that is made from a tree, meaning that is made of wood. This could be any kind of pole or wooden structure that would be used to suspend someone above the ground and could be used as a means of killing the person or to display the person’s body after the person is dead. This might mean: (1) by hanging them from it with a rope tied around the neck, or (2) by impaling them on it, that is, by sticking a sharp point on one end of a pole through their body. You could translate this as “a wooden pole” or “a gallows.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## g9nh
### וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֗ב (1)

## abi0
### וַֽ⁠יְנַשְּׂאֵ֑⁠הוּ וַ⁠יָּ֨שֶׂם֙ אֶת־כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֕ל כָּל־הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים (1)
These two phrases mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize that the king was making Haman very powerful. You could combine them and say something like, “the king gave Haman a very high position that was over all of his other officials.” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## pl9i
### וַֽ⁠יְנַשְּׂאֵ֑⁠הוּ (1)

# 3:2
## abi3
### וְ⁠כָל־עַבְדֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)
Here, the **gate of the king**, probably the entrance to the citadel, may figuratively represent the citadel itself, the place where these people served the king. The citadel, in turn, would represent everyone who served the king. So you could say just “all the king’s other servants.” However, this may also be a reference to the specific group of officials who were stationed at the gate, the way Mordecai was. Alternate translation: “the royal officials who were stationed at the palace gate” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abi4
### וְ⁠כָל־עַבְדֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ & כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ לְ⁠הָמָ֔ן (1)
The servants were required to do this as a way of honoring him whenever Haman walked by. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## e25k
### כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ (1)
This means that the other officials humbled themselves and lay flat on the ground before Haman. These actions represented recognition and respect for the very high position that the king had given him in the Persian government. (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abi5
### כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ (1)
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that the officials knew how important it was to obey the king’s command and honor Haman in this way. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “bow down all the way to the ground.” Alternate translation: “bowing and lying down on the ground” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## fg8v
### וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ (1)
This means bowing down all the way to the ground.

## jd99
### כִּי־כֵ֖ן צִוָּה־ל֣⁠וֹ (1)
If that would be clearer in your language, you can put this information first in the verse because it explains the reason why all the other officials were bowing to Haman. See the UST. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## abi6
### כִּי־כֵ֖ן צִוָּה־ל֣⁠וֹ (1)
The king did this as a sign of Haman’s new position. You can state this here or in a separate sentence, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “the king had commanded them to do this in order to show that he had given Haman such a high position” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abi7
### וּ⁠מָ֨רְדֳּכַ֔י לֹ֥א יִכְרַ֖ע וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽה (1)
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was against the king’s command and how much determination it took for Mordecai to remain standing. You could combine these phrases as UST does and say, “But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not bow down or lie on the ground” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## abi8
### וּ⁠מָ֨רְדֳּכַ֔י לֹ֥א יִכְרַ֖ע וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽה (1)
It appears that as a Jew, Mordecai considered it wrong to worship anyone other than Yahweh, and that he believed he would be worshiping Haman if he bowed down low to the ground to honor him. So, on religious grounds, Mordecai refused to bow down. You can say this explicitly if it would make your translation clearer. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 3:3
## abi9
### עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ (1)

## jd1r
### י֣וֹם וָ⁠י֔וֹם (1)
This expression means “every day.” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abj2
### וַ⁠יְהִ֗י ב⁠אמר⁠ם אֵלָי⁠ו֙ & וְ⁠לֹ֥א שָׁמַ֖ע אֲלֵי⁠הֶ֑ם (1)
Here, **he did not listen** means he did not heed their warning or he did not do what they said. Mordecai heard them, but he did not do what they advised him to do. This means that even though the other officials questioned him and probably warned him, he still refused to bow down. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## uek4
### וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣ידוּ לְ⁠הָמָ֗ן לִ⁠רְאוֹת֙ הֲ⁠יַֽעַמְדוּ֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י מָרְדֳּכַ֔י (1)
In this context, **standing** figuratively means to survive a challenge, and **words** means the reasons that Mordecai gave for his actions. This phrase means that the other officials told Haman about it to see if he would tolerate it. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abj3
### כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי (1)
This is the answer that Mordecai gave the other officials when they asked him why he refused to bow down to Haman. If that would be clearer in your language, you can put it first in the verse because it explains everything that happens afterwards. Alternate translation: “Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, and that Jews would bow down only to God” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## abj4
### כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי (1)
Mordecai’s explanation would have included the fact that Jews would only worship Yahweh. You could say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 3:5
## abj5
### וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא הָמָ֔ן (1)
Here, **seeing** figuratively means knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that Haman learned about this. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## njt5
### אֵ֣ין מָרְדֳּכַ֔י כֹּרֵ֥עַ וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶ֖ה ל֑⁠וֹ (1)
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was. You could combine them as UST does and say, “Mordecai was refusing to bow down to him.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai would not bow down or lie on the ground” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## wk8p
### וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֥א הָמָ֖ן חֵמָֽה (1)
Here, **Haman’s rage** is spoken of as something that could fill him up. You could say that he was furious or extremely angry. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 3:6
## k5h9
### וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “Haman considered that it was not enough” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abj6
### וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו (1)
Haman probably decided to go to such extremes because he was so angry. You could say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abj7
### וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז (1)
**Despise** in this context means not to hate but to think little of or think something is too small. This expression means that Haman decided it would not be enough just to kill Mordecai alone.

## jd9r
### בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו (1)
Here, **eyes** stand for “seeing,” and in this case “seeing” figuratively means judgment. This phrase means in Haman’s judgment. Alternate translation: “as he saw it” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## abj8
### לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙ בְּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֣י לְ⁠בַדּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
Alternate translation: “he rejected the idea of killing only Mordecai” or “he decided to kill more than just Mordecai” or “he decided that it would not be enough to get rid of only Mordecai”

## j11r
### לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙ (1)
As in [2:21](../02/21.md), the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abj9
### כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥ידוּ ל֖⁠וֹ אֶת־עַ֣ם מָרְדֳּכָ֑י (1)
**They** means the other royal officials. **Him** refers to Haman. **The people of Mordecai** means the Jews. Mordecai had told these officials that he would not bow down to Haman because Jews worshiped only God. So this means that the other officials had told Haman that Mordecai was not bowing down to him because he was a Jew.

## hue9
### וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֣שׁ הָמָ֗ן לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֧יד (1)
Here, **seeking** figuratively means trying to do something. In this context, it means that Haman decided that he would try to kill all the Jews. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## abk0
### בְּ⁠כָל־מַלְכ֥וּת אֲחַשְׁוֵר֖וֹשׁ (1)
This means in the entire empire that King Ahasuerus ruled.

## abk1
### הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֛ים & עַ֥ם מָרְדֳּכָֽי (1)
These two phrases refer to the same group of people. The repetition emphasizes how great the threat was to their existence. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “all of the Jews.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai’s people, the Jews” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

# 3:7
## zl12
### בַּ⁠חֹ֤דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁוֹן֙ (1)
Alternate translation: “In month one” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

## wyv6
### הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֔ן (1)
**Nisan** is the name of the first month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[translate-hebrewmonths]])

## abk2
### חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֔ן (1)
As in [2:16](../02/16.md), you could convert the Hebrew month into an approximate time on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to give the Hebrew month. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## tw99
### בִּ⁠שְׁנַת֙ שְׁתֵּ֣ים עֶשְׂרֵ֔ה לַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ (1)

## g4lt
### הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩ ה֨וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל (1)
The storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and the word for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. (See: [[translate-names]])

## abk3
### הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל (1)
A **lot** was an object with different markings on various sides that was used, most likely by dropping it on the ground, to select a specific time for doing something. The belief was that God or the gods would control which way the object fell, thus guiding the selection process and granting favor to the action if it were done on the date chosen. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abk4
### הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩ (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. You can say, for example, “Haman had his servants cast a Pur.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abk5
### הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩ (1)
If that would be clearer in your language, you can put this information first because it explains the rest of what happens in this verse. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## j13r
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הָמָ֗ן (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. In this context, the phrase means that Haman was physically present when the lot was cast. Alternate translation: “as Haman watched” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## j15r
### מִ⁠יּ֧וֹם ׀ לְ⁠י֛וֹם וּ⁠מֵ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ (1)

Haman was casting the lot to determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews. You can say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “to determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## ih4b
### שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר (1)
**Adar** is the name of the twelfth and last month of the Hebrew calendar. This name occurs several times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[translate-hebrewmonths]])

## abk6
### שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר (1)
See how you decided in [2:16](../02/16.md) and the first part of this verse to represent the dates that are given in the Hebrew calendar in the book of Esther. Be consistent.

## abk7
### שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר (1)
This means that the lot indicated the twelfth month of that year as the time for Haman to carry out his plan. You can say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. (The day that was chosen is reported in verse 13.) Alternate Translation: “the lot indicated the twelfth month, the month of Adar, as the best month to kill the Jews” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## k3vd
### שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר (1)
Alternative translation: “month twelve” or “the twelfth month” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

# 3:8
## abk8
### וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הָמָן֙ לַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֔וֹשׁ (1)
The implication is that Haman then went to see the king so that he could speak with him. You could say that explicitly. Do not give your readers the impression that the king was present with Haman while he was casting the lot. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aig9
### יֶשְׁנ֣⁠וֹ עַם־אֶחָ֗ד (1)
**He** refers to the king, and **one people** refers to the Jews as a people group. So this means there is a people group or a group of people. (See: [[translate-numbers]])

## p4a8
### מְפֻזָּ֤ר וּ⁠מְפֹרָד֙ (1)
These two words mean almost the same thing. Haman uses the repetition to emphasize that the Jews are everywhere throughout the empire and so their influence, which he says is bad, will affect everyone. You could combine these words as UST does. (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## abk9
### בֵּ֣ין הָֽ⁠עַמִּ֔ים בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל מְדִינ֣וֹת מַלְכוּתֶ֑⁠ךָ (1)
Haman is saying that the Jews are mixed in with all the other peoples, and they live in every province.

## abl0
### וְ⁠דָתֵי⁠הֶ֞ם שֹׁנ֣וֹת מִ⁠כָּל־עָ֗ם וְ⁠אֶת־דָּתֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ אֵינָ֣⁠ם עֹשִׂ֔ים (1)
Haman is saying that the Jews have their own set of laws, and he is accusing them of not obeying the king’s laws as a result.

## r34x
### דָּתֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ (1)
Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could have him say, “your laws.” Or you could indicate this respect another way by having Haman begin by saying, “Your Majesty.” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## bf9g
### וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֵין־שֹׁוֶ֖ה לְ⁠הַנִּיחָֽ⁠ם (1)
Haman is saying, “It is not good for you to allow them to live in your empire.” This can also be stated without the negative. Alternate translation: “the king should remove them” or “you should remove them”

## j19r
### וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ (1)
Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person by saying, “not good for you.” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## abl1
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב (1)
Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. (See: [[figs-123person]])

## abl2
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב (1)
See how you decided to translate this idiom in [1:19](../01/19.md). Alternate translation: “if it seems like a good idea to you, O king” or “if the king thinks this is a good idea” or “if this advice is pleasing to the king” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abl3
### יִכָּתֵ֖ב (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who would do the action. For example, you can say, “the king could write a decree” or “you could write a decree.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abl4
### לְ⁠אַבְּדָ֑⁠ם (1)
This means that the decree would say that all the Jews should be killed.

## eh3w
### אֶשְׁקוֹל֙ עַל־יְדֵי֙ עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה (1)
This could mean either of two possibilities: (1) Haman could mean that the king’s men will be able to collect a huge amount of money from the plunder that they would get from the Jews. Referring to the weight would be a way of saying, “I guarantee that it will be at least that much.” This reasoning agrees with 3:13, where the king’s letter specifies that those who kill the Jews can take their plunder. Alternate translation: “we will get so much plunder that the officers you send will be able to bring back” (Also see UST) (2) “**Weigh out into the hands**” could be an idiom that means Haman himself will pay the officers who will put the plan into effect. Haman will not do this personally, but it means that he will take responsibility for paying them from his own resources. Alternate translation: “From my own resources I will pay … to the men who do the work” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## lhv5
### וַ⁠עֲשֶׂ֨רֶת אֲלָפִ֜ים כִּכַּר־כֶּ֗סֶף (1)
This would be worth over $300 million at current prices in 2020. But since prices vary over time, if you expressed the value in modern measurements, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the talent, and explain in a note that a talent was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does in metric tons. (See: [[translate-bmoney]])

## vm59
### וַ⁠עֲשֶׂ֨רֶת אֲלָפִ֜ים כִּכַּר־כֶּ֗סֶף (1)
The **talent** was the largest unit of money and **10,000** was the largest number in the counting system of the time. It is possible that Haman used these terms to represent a very large, but not precise, amount. Alternate translation: “a huge amount of silver” or “enormous amounts of silver” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## abl5
### עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה (1)
This could mean: (1) those who work for the king in general (administrators) or (2) more specifically the officers whom Ahasuerus would send around the empire to organize the killing of the Jews.

## abl7
### גִּנְזֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. You could also have him speak of “your royal treasuries.” (See: [[figs-123person]])

# 3:10
## abl8
### וַ⁠יָּ֧סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֗⁠הּ לְ⁠הָמָ֧ן (1)
The implication is that Ahasuerus thought that Haman’s suggestion was a good idea and he agreed to it. You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king agreed that this was a good idea, so” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abl9
### וַ⁠יָּ֧סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֗⁠הּ לְ⁠הָמָ֧ן (1)
**Giving the ring to Haman** showed that Haman could act on the king’s own authority. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king gave Haman the power to act on his authority to carry out the plan. To show that, he gave Haman the ring he wore that had his official seal on it” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## c9md
### טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ (1)
This was a special ring that could be used to imprint the king’s official seal on a law or decree. This ring had the king’s name or mark on it. When he put a wax seal on important papers, he would press the mark onto the seal. If a paper had this mark on its seal, people would know that what was written on the paper was written with the king’s authority and had to be obeyed. You could describe this as “the ring he wore that had his official seal on it.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abm0
### בֶּֽן־הַמְּדָ֛תָא הָ⁠אֲגָגִ֖י (1)
This information about Haman’s identity is repeated to stress that the king giving him the signet ring was an official legal act that transferred power to him. (In the same way, legal documents today often use a person’s full name and other identifying information.) If you repeat this information in your own translation, your readers should see this significance.

## abm1
### צֹרֵ֥ר הַ⁠יְּהוּדִֽים (1)
This phrase gives clarifying information about Haman. It means that he had become “the enemy of the Jews.” (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

# 3:11
## sz4b
### הַ⁠כֶּ֖סֶף נָת֣וּן לָ֑⁠ךְ (1)
You can say this with an active form. This could mean one of the following things: (1) “You can keep the money from plundering the Jews for yourself.” (2) “I give you permission to take the money from the Jews and to give it to the men just as you have said.” (3) “You do not need to pay for the expenses of the plan yourself.” (4) This statement by the king may also be a formal and cultural way of expressing gratitude for the promised money without actually releasing Haman from paying the money into the treasury. (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abm2
### וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֕ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת בּ֖⁠וֹ כַּ⁠טּ֥וֹב בְּ⁠עֵינֶֽי⁠ךָ (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. The king is telling Haman that **he can do whatever he wants to the Jews**. Alternate translation: “you can do to the Jews as you see fit” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 3:12
## hx6c
### וַ⁠יִּקָּרְאוּ֩ סֹפְרֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ (1)
You can say this with an active form. You can also say who did the action. It was most likely Haman, since the king had given him authority to act on his behalf. So you could say, “Haman called in the royal scribes.” Alternate translation: “the king summoned his scribes” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## t6qa
### בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒ (1)
Alternate translation: “on the thirteenth day of the first month” You can add “of that same year” to show that Haman did this right after Ahasuerus agreed to his plan. (See: [[translate-hebrewmonths]])

## abm3
### בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒ (1)
You can put this information first because it places the event within the timeline of the story.

## abm4
### וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֣ב כְּֽ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֣ה הָמָ֡ן (1)
You can say this with an active form. You can also say who did the action. Alternate translation: “and Haman dictated a letter to them” or “they wrote a decree containing all that Haman had commanded” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abm5
### אֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנֵֽי־הַ֠⁠מֶּלֶךְ (1)
This seems to mean the officials of the king who served in the palace in the capital city, since they are distinguished from the provincial governors and the leaders of the people groups. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## j23r
### מְדִינָ֣ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֗ה (1)
This expression means every province**.** See how you translated this in 1:22. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abm7

Alternate translation: “the leaders of each people group”

## abm8
### מְדִינָ֤ה וּ⁠מְדִינָה֙ כִּ⁠כְתָבָ֔⁠הּ (1)
The implication is that the scribes translated the letter and sent it to each province using its own alphabet. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j31r
### וְ⁠עַ֥ם וָ⁠עָ֖ם כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ (1)
See how you translated this expression in [1:22](../01/22.md). Alternate translation: “and to each people group in its own language” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## j33r
### כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ (1)
Here, **tongue** is a metonym meaning the language spoken by a person or a group of people. Alternate translation: “according to its language” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abm9
### בְּ⁠שֵׁ֨ם הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֹשׁ֙ נִכְתָּ֔ב (1)
There are two possible meanings: (1) Here, **name** could mean the authority of the king. This would be saying that Haman’s letter had the same authority as it would have had if the king had sent it himself. Alternate translation: “Haman sent the letter under the king’s own authority” (2) However, this could also mean that Haman actually had the scribes sign the king’s name to the letter. Alternate translation: “they signed the king’s name at the end of the letters” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## lyf2
### נִכְתָּ֔ב וְ⁠נֶחְתָּ֖ם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֥עַת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “to show that he was sending the letter under the king’s own authority, Haman sealed each copy of the letter with the ring that had the king’s official seal on it,” or “the scribes signed the king’s name at the end of the letters. Then they sealed the letters with wax, and stamped the wax by using the king’s ring” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 3:13
## hxx6
### וְ⁠נִשְׁל֨וֹחַ סְפָרִ֜ים (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. For example, you can say, “couriers delivered the letters.” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## j34r
### בְּ⁠יַ֣ד הָ⁠רָצִים֮ (1)
Here, **hand** could mean two different things: (1) It could literally mean “hand,” meaning that the couriers carried the letters in their hands. Alternate translation: “couriers hand-delivered the documents” (2) “Hand” could also be a metaphor for power, control, or authority, meaning that couriers were the ones who delivered the letters to all the provinces throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “couriers gave the documents directly” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## abn0
### אֶל־כָּל־מְדִינ֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒ (1)
Haman did not send the letters to the provinces (the geographical territories) themselves. Rather, he sent them to the officials in every province in the empire. The story is using the word “province” to refer figuratively to these officials by something associated with them, the territories they ruled. Your translation should make clear that the letters were sent to people, not places. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## xs6g
### לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֡יד לַ⁠הֲרֹ֣ג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֣ד (1)
These words mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction that is envisioned. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “completely destroy.” (A “doublet” can use more than two words. See: [[figs-doublet]])

## abn1
### מִ⁠נַּ֨עַר וְ⁠עַד־זָקֵ֜ן (1)
This is a figure of speech that figuratively describes all of something by naming two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between.

Alternate translation: “including the children and the women”

This expression means each and every province. See how you translated the term “province” in 1:1. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## l9w7
### הַ⁠כְּתָ֗ב & גָּל֖וּי לְ⁠כָל־הָֽ⁠עַמִּ֑ים (1)

## i12c
### וְ⁠הַ⁠דָּ֥ת נִתְּנָ֖ה (1)
You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. For example, you can say, “People read the letter out loud” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## nlk8
### בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֣ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֑ה (1)
Here this likely means in the “capital city of Susa.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abn6
### יָשְׁב֣וּ לִ⁠שְׁתּ֔וֹת (1)
(1) This could mean that Ahasuerus and Haman had more than just a drink together. This could be a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. They may have celebrated with an entire banquet that is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “had a celebration feast together” (2) Another possibility is that this is describing a toast that Ahasuerus and Haman shared to celebrate their plan. “Sat down” would simply be describing how the men would have reclined at a table to drink. Alternate translation: “had a celebration toast” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## wm4u
### נָבֽוֹכָה (1)

The author wants us to see the contrast between the king and Haman sitting down to relax and drink and the people in the city agitated and in an uproar over what the king and Haman had proclaimed. Use a connecting word or other way that your language uses to show a contrast.
(See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## abn7
### וְ⁠הָ⁠עִ֥יר שׁוּשָׁ֖ן (1)
This does not mean the city itself, but the people who live there. This is a figure of speech in which something is called not by its own name, but by the name of something closely associated with it. So this means “everyone who lived in Susa” or the people in Susa (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abn8
### נָבֽוֹכָה (1)
You can translate the abstract noun **confusion** with a verbal phrase such as “was very confused.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## abo0
### וַ⁠יֵּצֵא֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הָ⁠עִ֔יר (1)
The next verse shows that Mordecai was heading towards the king’s palace. You could say that explicitly here. Mordecai might have wanted to call attention to the danger that the Jews were in by going to a public location where people were used to seeing him. Or he might have wanted to contact Esther and ask her to help with the trouble. Or he might have wanted both. Alternate translation: “he started walking towards the city center, towards the king’s palace” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abo1
### וַ⁠יִּזְעַ֛ק זְעָקָ֥ה גְדֹלָ֖ה וּ⁠מָרָֽה (1)

# 4:3
## e73y
### וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־מְדִינָ֣ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֗ה (1)

## y8bc
### וַ⁠תִּשְׁלַ֨ח בְּגָדִ֜ים לְ⁠הַלְבִּ֣ישׁ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֗י (1)

## icg7
### מִ⁠סָּרִיסֵ֤י (1)
See how you translated this term **eunuch** in [1:10](../01/10.md). (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## j39r
### לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠הָ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. This phrase means that the guardians served Esther personally. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abp6
### לָ⁠דַ֥עַת מַה־זֶּ֖ה וְ⁠עַל־מַה־זֶּֽה (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. In both cases, “this” refers to what Mordecai was doing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Esther now knew there must be a very serious reason why Mordecai was wearing sackcloth in such a public place. Alternate translation: “to find out why he was so distressed that he was sitting at the palace gate wearing sackcloth” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

# 4:6
## abp7
### וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֥א הֲתָ֖ךְ אֶֽל־מָרְדֳּכָ֑י (1)

## zt49
### הַ֠⁠דָּת אֲשֶׁר־נִתַּ֨ן בְּ⁠שׁוּשָׁ֤ן (1)
If it would help your readers to understand, you can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the law that the heralds had read out loud in Susa” or “the decree that the king’s servants had posted in Susa” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## abq0
### לְ⁠הַשְׁמִידָ⁠ם֙ (1)

## abq1
### לְ⁠הַרְא֥וֹת אֶת־אֶסְתֵּ֖ר וּ⁠לְ⁠הַגִּ֣יד לָ֑⁠הּ (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. They are repeated to emphasize how important Mordecai knew it was for Esther to understand just what Haman was planning. “so that Esther could see exactly what it said.” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## abq2
### וּ⁠לְ⁠צַוּ֣וֹת עָלֶ֗י⁠הָ (1)
Alternate translation: “and to urge her”

## gds6
### לְ⁠הִֽתְחַנֶּן־ל֛⁠וֹ וּ⁠לְ⁠בַקֵּ֥שׁ (1)

## j47r
### מִ⁠לְּ⁠פָנָ֖י⁠ו (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. In this context, the phrase means that Esther should go into the presence of the king to ask personally for the king’s intervention. Alternate translation: “to go to the king personally” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abq3
### עַל־עַמָּֽ⁠הּ (1)

## abq6
### כָּל־עַבְדֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ וְ⁠עַם־מְדִינ֨וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ יֽוֹדְעִ֗ים (1)
**All the servants of the king** refers to the royal officials in the palace. **The people of the provinces** refers to those living out in the empire. So this phrase means something like “those both near and far.” Esther is using a figure of speech to refer to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between those parts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like, “everyone in the whole empire knows.” Alternate translation: “all the king’s officials and all the people in the empire know this law” (See: [[figs-merism]])

## abq7
### כָּל־עַבְדֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ וְ⁠עַם־מְדִינ֨וֹת הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ יֽוֹדְעִ֗ים (1)
Esther says this to show that there is no uncertainty about this being the law. You can put this information after the description of the law itself, if that would be clearer in your language, so that it can serve to emphasize how definite the law is that was just described.

## d9mh
### כָּל־אִ֣ישׁ וְ⁠אִשָּׁ֡ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר (1)
Here, Esther once again refers to a group figuratively by describing two parts of it. She means all of the people whom Ahasuerus rules as king. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like “anyone”. (See: [[figs-merism]])

## abq8
### יָבֽוֹא־אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֩ אֶל־הֶ⁠חָצֵ֨ר הַ⁠פְּנִימִ֜ית (1)
As [5:1](../05/01.md) makes clear, this refers to a courtyard right outside the room where King Ahasuerus sat on his throne. He could see out of the entrance to the room into the courtyard and tell if anyone came and stood there. Anyone who did that was asking to speak to the king. Alternate translation: “who goes into the inner courtyard of the palace, where the king can see them” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abq9
### אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹֽא־יִקָּרֵ֗א (1)

(See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abr3
### שַׁרְבִ֥יט הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב (1)
A scepter was an ornamental staff or wand that rulers carried or held as a symbol of their authority. According to this, the scepter of King Ahasuerus was made of gold. Alternate translation: “golden scepter” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## ilp4
### וְ⁠חָיָ֑ה (1)
This means that the guards will not kill this person and he can proceed to speak to the king. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “then the guards will not kill him and he can speak to the king” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abr4
### וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י לֹ֤א נִקְרֵ֨אתי֙ לָ⁠ב֣וֹא אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ זֶ֖ה שְׁלוֹשִׁ֥ים יֽוֹם (1)
Esther is saying by implication that she cannot speak to the king as Mordecai has requested because the king has not been calling for her, which would have given her an opportunity to speak to him. If she goes without being summoned, she could be put to death. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j49r
### וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י (1)
This expression indicates a contrast between Esther’s present situation and the situation she has just described. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## abr5
### זֶ֖ה שְׁלוֹשִׁ֥ים יֽוֹם (1)
The phrase means that Esther has not been called in the king’s presence for a period of at least 30 days. You could use an equivalent expression in your language that would indicate this is a long enough time that Esther has reason to believe the king is not interested in seeing her. Alternate translation: “in over a month”

## gv1v
### זֶ֖ה שְׁלוֹשִׁ֥ים יֽוֹם (1)
Alternate translation: “thirty days” (See: [[translate-numbers]])

# 4:12
## abr6
### וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣ידוּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֔י (1)
From this point on, the author focuses only on Mordecai and Esther and does not specify who the messenger is. You can use a general phrase such as, “they told Mordecai” or “Mordecai was told” or “messengers told Mordecai.” If that would be confusing, you can continue to specify that the messenger was Hathak, as the ancient Greek version did. See the UST.

# 4:13
## abr7
### וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר מָרְדֳּכַ֖י לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶל־אֶסְתֵּ֑ר (1)
Alternate translation: “then Mordecai sent back this message to Esther”

## i1uy
### רֶ֣וַח וְ⁠הַצָּלָ֞ה יַעֲמ֤וֹד לַ⁠יְּהוּדִים֙ מִ⁠מָּק֣וֹם אַחֵ֔ר (1)
Here, **relief** and **deliverance** are spoken of as if they are living things that can rise up. Alternate translation: “someone else will rise up from another place and rescue the Jews” (See: [[figs-personification]])

## t3k7
### רֶ֣וַח וְ⁠הַצָּלָ֞ה (1)
Here, **relief** and **deliverance** mean very similar things. They are used together to emphasize the great emotion behind being delivered from this great evil. If it works better in your language, you can use one word instead of two, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## abs0
### וְ⁠אַ֥תְּ וּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֖י⁠ךְ תֹּאבֵ֑דוּ (1)
Alternate translation: “you and your relatives will be killed” The implication is that the Jews will be rescued starting in that other place, but the ones living in Susa will still be in danger because no one who could have helped them there (such as Esther) would have done anything.

## dtg7
### וּ⁠מִ֣י יוֹדֵ֔עַ אִם־לְ⁠עֵ֣ת כָּ⁠זֹ֔את הִגַּ֖עַתְּ לַ⁠מַּלְכֽוּת (1)
This is really a statement, and it is about what is happening right then. Mordecai asks it in question form so that Esther will think deeply about her role in this situation. Alternate translation: “who knows, perhaps it was to intervene in this very situation that you became queen” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

# 4:16
## d6cq
### כָּל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים הַֽ⁠נִּמְצְאִ֣ים בְּ⁠שׁוּשָׁ֗ן (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “all the Jews who live here in Susa” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## t2wg
### וְ⁠צ֣וּמוּ עָ֠לַ⁠י (1)
The verb **fast** here is plural, including Mordecai and all of the Jews. Fasting (that is, going without eating) was a symbolic act that the Jews did when they were praying intensely. You could make the connection with prayer explicit. Alternate translation: “fast and pray for me” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## qw8v
### וְ⁠אַל־תֹּאכְל֨וּ וְ⁠אַל־תִּשְׁתּ֜וּ שְׁלֹ֤שֶׁת יָמִים֙ לַ֣יְלָה וָ⁠י֔וֹם (1)

## abs4

Alternate translation: “then if they kill me, they kill me”

# 4:17
## abs5
### וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֖ר מָרְדֳּכָ֑י (1)
The implication is that Mordecai did this after Hathak brought Esther’s reply back to him. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “so after Hathak told this to Mordecai, he went” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abs6
### כְּ⁠כֹ֛ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוְּתָ֥ה עָלָ֖י⁠ו אֶסְתֵּֽר (1)

## j53r
### וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֗י (1)
This introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “three days later” or “when Esther had been fasting for three days” (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## abs7
### וַ⁠תִּלְבַּ֤שׁ אֶסְתֵּר֙ מַלְכ֔וּת (1)
You can use an adjective and a concrete noun to translate the abstract noun “royalty,” as in the UST, or you could use a phrase to explain what they were. Alternate translation: “Esther put on the robes that showed that she was the queen” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## abs8
### וַ⁠תִּלְבַּ֤שׁ אֶסְתֵּר֙ מַלְכ֔וּת (1)
It is clear from the story that before she went to see the king, Esther got a banquet ready so that she could invite him and Haman to come to it right away. If it is confusing to leave that out, you can explain that here. Alternate translation, add: “Esther prepared a grand banquet and then put on her royal robes” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abs9
### בַּ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠פְּנִימִ֔ית (1)

**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to those things that belonged only to the king. You can translate this idea with a verb, “the throne he ruled from” and “the palace where he reigned,” or with an adjective, “his royal throne” and “his royal palace.” Alternate translation: “in the throne room of the palace, sitting on the king’s throne” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

See how you translated similar expressions in 2:9, 2:15, and 2:17. Review the explanations there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus **thought Esther looked very attractive** as she stood in the court. It could also mean that King Ahasuerus was very pleased to see her. It could mean both. Alternate translation: “he was very pleased to see her” or “he approved of her” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## pw4x
### נָשְׂאָ֥ה חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that King Ahasuerus decided not to kill Esther for coming into the inner court without being summoned. Alternate translation: “he was very pleased to see her” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## uu8s
### וַ⁠יּ֨וֹשֶׁט הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֗ר אֶת־שַׁרְבִ֤יט הַ⁠זָּהָב֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠יָד֔⁠וֹ (1)
King Ahasuerus did this to show that he would not enforce the law that said that Esther should be executed for coming into the king’s inner court without being summoned. See how you translated this in 4:11. Alternate translation: “he extended the gold scepter toward her.” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abt3
### וַ⁠יּ֨וֹשֶׁט הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֗ר אֶת־שַׁרְבִ֤יט הַ⁠זָּהָב֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠יָד֔⁠וֹ (1)
King Ahasuerus did this to show that he would not enforce the law that said Esther should be executed. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly.

## abt5
### וַ⁠תִּגַּ֖ע בְּ⁠רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠שַּׁרְבִֽיט (1)
This action demonstrated that Esther respected the authority of King Ahasuerus and was thankful for his kindness to her. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include that information here, such as: “ … to show that she respected his authority.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j59r
### בְּ⁠רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠שַּׁרְבִֽיט (1)
Here, **head** is a metonym meaning the top (or uppermost part) of an object or location. This phrase means that Esther touched the top of the king’s scepter on the end that was extended toward her. Alternate translation: “the top of the scepter” or “the tip of the scepter” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## abt7
### מַה־לָּ֖⁠ךְ אֶסְתֵּ֣ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֑ה וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ (1)
These two phrases mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is very interested in hearing why Esther has come to see him. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if it would be more natural in your language to combine them into one. Alternate translation: “What do you want, Queen Esther?” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## j61r
### עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ (1)
This was probably a formal and customary expression in the Persian royal court, meant to show honor to the person making a request of the king and to indicate the king’s willingness to be very generous when answering the request. King Ahasuerus was almost certainly not offering to give Esther half of his kingdom. If it would be clearer to your readers, you could express the meaning: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.” Alternate translation: “I will give you what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## c6h7
### וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ (1)

# 5:4
## abt8
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב (1)
This is an idiom. See how you translated it in 1:19 and 3:9. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## m3uy
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב (1)

Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “the banquet that I have prepared for you” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## abu0
### הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֥יתִי לֽ⁠וֹ (1)
If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be singular, since here it refers just to the king. (See: [[figs-yousingular]])

# 5:5
## abu1
### וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
The king would have said this to his servants, not to Esther. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king said to his servants” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abu2
### מַהֲרוּ֙ אֶת־הָמָ֔ן לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֑ר (1)

These two question-and-statement pairs mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice in slightly different ways to show that he is truly disposed to give Esther whatever she wants. If this is confusing, you do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation. You could combine them into one or replace the repetition with a statement of what the repetition means, as in the UST. Alternate translation: “now please tell me what you really want. I will do it for you” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## pj3p

When Ahasuerus asked Esther in the throne room what she wanted, she said that she wanted him and Haman to come to a banquet she had prepared. But since the king asks her once again at the banquet what she wants, it is clear that he knew this was not her real request. Instead, he knew that she wanted to show him hospitality first, as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship. You can indicate this by translating, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## q5nt
### שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ & בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ (1)
The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 5:7
## abu5
### וַ⁠תַּ֥עַן & וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֑ר (1)
Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” or “replied” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## r4aw
### שְׁאֵלָתִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י (1)

## abu7
### אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment.

### יָב֧וֹא הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ וְ⁠הָמָ֗ן אֶל־הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֣ה לָ⁠הֶ֔ם (1)
If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be dual if your language uses that form, since it refers to the king and Haman, otherwise it should be plural. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

## abu9

## j75r
### וְ⁠ט֣וֹב לֵ֑ב (1)
Here, **heart** figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. The phrase means that Haman felt happy. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## dkg6
### וְ⁠לֹא־קָם֙ (1)
Under other circumstances, officials were expected to bow low to the ground to show respect for Haman. See [3:2](../03/02.md). But since Mordecai was already sitting on the ground as a sign of mourning, he would have been expected to stand up to show respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not stand up to show respect for Haman” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j77r
### וְ⁠לֹא־זָ֣ע מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ (1)
The phrase means that Mordecai was not afraid of Haman or of what Haman might do to him for refusing to show the respect that the king had commanded. Alternate translation: “or tremble fearfully in front of him” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## s47u
### וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֥א הָמָ֛ן עַֽל־מָרְדֳּכַ֖י חֵמָֽה (1)

# 5:10
## v5nl
### וַ⁠יִּתְאַפַּ֣ק הָמָ֔ן (1)
There is a contrast between this sentence and the previous one. Haman felt very much like doing one thing, but he decided it would be better to do something else. The contrast can be indicated with a phrase such as “but even though.” Alternate translation: “but even though Haman was so angry, he kept himself from losing his temper” or “Haman refused to show how angry he was” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## j79r
### וְ⁠רֹ֣ב בָּנָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Having many sons was probably seen as a mark of honor and status in Persian culture. This phrase probably means that Haman was boasting about the status he enjoyed in Persian society because he had many sons. Alternate translation: “how many sons he had” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## abv5
### בָּנָ֑י⁠ו (1)
This word can sometimes be used in Hebrew to mean both male and female children. However, here it clearly refers to male children, so you should translate it that way. (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

## abv6
### הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים וְ⁠עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)

## xwvh
### הַ⁠שָּׂרִ֖ים וְ⁠עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)

# 5:12

## w1bm
### לֹא־הֵבִיאָה֩ אֶסְתֵּ֨ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֧ה עִם־הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ & כִּ֣י אִם־אוֹתִ֑⁠י (1)

### וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה אֵינֶ֥⁠נּוּ שֹׁוֶ֖ה לִ֑⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־עֵ֗ת אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲנִ֤י רֹאֶה֙ (1)
This is a figurative way of speaking. It is as if Haman is weighing his happiness on one side of a scale and his unhappiness on the other side. Haman is saying that his happiness over all the honors he has received is still not greater than his unhappiness over seeing Mordecai fail to honor him, so on balance, he is unhappy. Alternate translation: “I still cannot be happy as long as I keep seeing” or “all of this does not make me happy” or “ … does not satisfy me” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## wu84
### וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה (1)
Haman is continuing to speak here. You can show this by beginning with “Then Haman said.”

## abw1
### הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔י (1)
This phrase gives clarifying information about Mordecai. (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

## abw2
### יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Haman could be referring to the way Mordecai has been refusing to stand up to honor him, or he could be referring generally to the way Mordecai has never honored him (by either bowing or standing up) ever since he was appointed to a position in the king’s service and stationed at the gate. Either way, being reminded of this dishonor is the reason why Haman continues to be unhappy. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “sitting at the citadel gate and refusing to honor me” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abw3
### בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Alternate translation: “the citadel gate”

# 5:14
## abw4
### וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֩ זֶ֨רֶשׁ אִשְׁתּ֜⁠וֹ וְ⁠כָל־אֹֽהֲבָ֗י⁠ו (1)
The verb is feminine, so it is Zeresh who is speaking here. By mentioning the friends, it is implied that they are in agreement with what she says. If it would be clearer, you could say, “Then Haman’s wife Zeresh suggested, and his friends agreed.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j81r
### וְ⁠כָל־אֹֽהֲבָ֗י⁠ו (1)
This means the friends whom Haman had invited to his home that day. Alternate translation: “his friends who were there”

## abw5

## k8zd
### גָּבֹ֣הַּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אַמָּה֒ (1)

## hiui
### אֱמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠יִתְל֤וּ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַי֙ עָלָ֔י⁠ו (1)
If it is clearer in your language, you can make explicit what Haman would say to the king. Alternate translation: “speak to the king and tell him that you would like to hang Mordecai on it” or “tell the king that you intend to hang Mordecai on it” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abw7
### וְ⁠יִתְל֤וּ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַי֙ עָלָ֔י⁠ו (1)
If it is clearer in your language, you can make explicit who does the action. Probably, Haman’s servants would carry out the action. But since it would happen under Haman’s orders and perhaps under his supervision, you could also describe him as the one who does the action if that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “and have your servants hang Mordecai on it” or “and hang Mordecai on it” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abw8
### וּ⁠בֹֽא & אֶל הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה שָׂמֵ֑חַ (1)
**Then** indicates more than a time sequence here. Zeresh and the friends are saying what the result would be. Alternate translation: “after he is dead, you will be able to go to the banquet … in a good mood” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## bbs9
### וַ⁠יִּיטַ֧ב הַ⁠דָּבָ֛ר לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן (1)
The **word** was the suggestion that Zeresh and the friends made. Here, **face** figuratively represents Haman himself by something associated with him, his face, which showed what he was thinking and feeling.

## i8is
### וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ הָ⁠עֵֽץ (1)
Haman most likely did not do this personally. He ordered it to be done. Alternate translation: “he gave his servants orders to set up the pole” or “he told his servants to construct the gallows”

## j83r
### הָ⁠עֵֽץ (1)
You should translate this the same way you did earlier in the verse, “the pole” or “the gallows.” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abx1
### וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר לְ⁠הָבִ֞יא (1)
**He** means the king. The implication is that he told the young men who attended him to do this. Verses 3 and 5 indicate this. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “so he commanded his servants to fetch” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abx2
### סֵ֤פֶר הַ⁠זִּכְרֹנוֹת֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּמִ֔ים (1)
This is equivalent to the expression “the book of the events of days” in [2:23](../02/23.md). See how you translated that expression. Alternate translation: “the royal chronicles” or “the records of what had happened during all the time that he had been king”

## abx3

This means that the chronicles were read out loud. You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the young men got the chronicles and began to read them out loud” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## j87r
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)

Alternate translation: “Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering a plot against the king and telling him about it” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abx5
### הִגִּ֨יד מָרְדֳּכַ֜י עַל (1)

## syd9
### בִּגְתָ֣נָא וָ⁠תֶ֗רֶשׁ (1)
These are the same two men who are named in [2:21](../02/21.md). However, there the first man’s name is said to be “Bigthan.” Decide on a consistent way of translating these names so your readers will know that they are the same men. (See: [[translate-names]])

## abx6
### שְׁנֵי֙ סָרִיסֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
See how you translated the term **eunuch** in [1:10](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: “two of the royal guardians” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## abx7
### מִ⁠שֹּׁמְרֵ֖י הַ⁠סַּ֑ף (1)

## j89r
### לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֣חַ יָ֔ד (1)
As in [2:21](../02/21.md), the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. Alternate translation: “to assassinate” or “to kill” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 6:3
## lmz6
### מַֽה־נַּעֲשָׂ֞ה יְקָ֧ר וּ⁠גְדוּלָּ֛ה לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֖י (1)
**Honor** and **greatness** have similar meanings and they are used together to emphasize that Mordecai should certainly have been honored in some grand way for saving the king’s life. If it would be clearer in your language, you can express this by putting the terms together. For example, you could say, “What great honor was done for Mordecai?” Alternate translation: “what did we do to reward Mordecai or to show that we appreciated what he did” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## aby0
### נַּעֲשָׂ֞ה (1)

## n2az
### לֹא־נַעֲשָׂ֥ה עִמּ֖⁠וֹ דָּבָֽר (1)

## aby1
### עַל־זֶ֑ה (1)
Alternate translation: “for saving my life”

# 6:4
## aby2
### מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר (1)
This could mean either: (1) The king knows that there is someone in the courtyard, maybe because he heard someone walking there; he wants to know who it is. (2) Since there are always people around the palace, the king assumes that there must be someone out in the courtyard. In either case, the king wants to know if there is someone there with whom he could consult about the best way to honor Mordecai. As the story has already said in [1:13](../01/13.md), it was the king’s habit to consult his advisors on important questions. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king wanted to consult someone about the best way to honor Mordecai, so he asked, ‘who is in the courtyard’” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aby3
### מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר (1)
In order to present the events in logical and chronological order, you can put the king’s question last in the verse if that would be more natural in your language. Haman had already come in the courtyard by the time the king asked this question.

## j91r
### וְ⁠הָמָ֣ן בָּ֗א לַ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠חִ֣יצוֹנָ֔ה לֵ⁠אמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ לִ⁠תְלוֹת֙ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֔י עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ אֲשֶׁר־הֵכִ֥ין לֽ⁠וֹ (1)
This sentence indicates that Haman had already entered the outer court when King Ahasuerus asked his question. You could indicate this with a phrase such as “at that moment” or “just then” or “while they were talking” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-background]])

## rg8t
### לַ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠חִ֣יצוֹנָ֔ה (1)

## at53

## aby4
### הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ (1)
See how you translated this term in [2:23](../02/23.md) and [5:14](../05/14.md). Review
the note to [2:23](../02/23.md) if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “pole” or “gallows” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

# 6:5
## aby5
### וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמְר֜וּ נַעֲרֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ (1)
It is implied that the young men went and looked, perhaps through a window or a doorway, to see who might be in the courtyard before they answered the king. You can say so if it would make the translation clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “the young men who served the king looked and saw that Haman was in the courtyard. They said” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j93r
### הִנֵּ֥ה (1)
This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation. You could also have the young men address the king directly to get his attention. Alternate translation: “O king” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j95r
### יָבֽוֹא (1)

Here the king speaks of himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the first person instead. Alternate translation: “what should I do for the man whom I would really like to honor” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## n3r5
### אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ (1)

## jh4i
### וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הָמָן֙ בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
Here, **heart** could mean two different things: (1) Heart could figuratively represent the action of thinking or feeling. In that case, the phrase would mean “then Haman said in his thoughts.” (2) Heart could also be a metaphor meaning to be inside someone or something. In that case, the phrase would mean “then Haman said inside himself.” Either way, the phrase means that Haman was not saying this out loud, but saying it to himself in his thoughts. Alternate translation: “Haman thought to himself” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## yft1
### לְ⁠מִ֞י יַחְפֹּ֥ץ הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת יְקָ֖ר יוֹתֵ֥ר מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי (1)
Haman is actually making a statement to himself rather than asking a question and trying to figure out the answer. He uses a question form to emphasize how true he believes the statement to be. If it would be clearer in your language, instead of a question, you could use a statement such as, “Surely there is no one whom the king would take pleasure in honoring more than me!” Alternate translation: “whom would the king like to honor more than me” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## j1d1
### אִ֕ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֥ץ בִּ⁠יקָרֽ⁠וֹ (1)

## aby7
### לְב֣וּשׁ מַלְכ֔וּת אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to anything that belongs to the king. You can translate this idea with an adjective, “a royal garment.” Alternate translation: “one of your own royal robes that you have already worn yourself” or “one of the robes you wear to show that you are the king” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## aby8
### אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)

## aby9
### וְ⁠ס֗וּס אֲשֶׁ֨ר רָכַ֤ב עָלָי⁠ו֙ (1)

## r63j
### וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִתַּ֛ן כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת בְּ⁠רֹאשֽׁ⁠וֹ (1)

The implication is that this would be done to show that this was one of the king’s own horses. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and that has a royal crown on its head to show that it belongs to you” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## abz1
### כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת (1)

Here, **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. It appears that the king himself would not perform such acts of service to one of his subjects even if he really wanted to honor that person. So Haman is saying that on behalf of the king, representing his authority and power, one of the king’s most noble officials should present the man with the robe and the horse. Alternate translation: “then, on your behalf, have one of your most noble officials present the man with the robe and the horse” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## pfz6
### וְ⁠הִלְבִּ֨ישׁוּ֙ (1)

### הָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּֽ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ (1)

In either case, this would have been a public area where people could gather, and so it was a place where a great number of people would have seen how the king was honoring Mordecai. Alternate translation: “through the public square of the city”

## qs3k

Alternate translation: “and tell the noble official and servants to proclaim” or “and have them shout out”

**To delight** in doing something means to be glad to do something or to want to do something. Alternate translation: “the king is doing this because he really wants to honor this man” or “this is what the king does when he especially wants to honor someone” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## pwgm
### כָּ֚כָה יֵעָשֶׂ֣ה (1)

# 6:10
## j2d1
### וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ (1)

## abz6
### הַ⁠יּוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
As in [2:19](../02/19.md), this is likely an idiom which means that Mordecai worked for the king in some capacity and was stationed at the gate. Alternate translation: “one of my servants, who is stationed at the king’s gate” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## abz7
### הַ⁠יּוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)
Here the king speaks of himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the first person. Alternate translation: “one of my servants, who is stationed at the gate to the palace” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## gln7
### אַל־תַּפֵּ֣ל דָּבָ֔ר (1)
Here the action of letting **fall** is a metaphor meaning to leave out or leave unfulfilled. The phrase means that Haman must do absolutely everything that he said. Alternate translation: “do not leave out anything that you suggested” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## abz8
### אַל־תַּפֵּ֣ל דָּבָ֔ר (1)

# 6:11
## abz9
### וַ⁠יַּרְכִּיבֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ בִּ⁠רְח֣וֹב הָ⁠עִ֔יר (1)
See how you translated these expressions in verse 9. Alternate translation: “seated him on the horse and then led the horse through the public square of the city”

## j2d5
### וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֣א לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that Haman shouted out to the people in front of Mordecai, that is, the people who were in the path of his horse as it approached. Alternate translation: “called out to all of the people in front of him” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## j2d7
### אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֥ץ בִּ⁠יקָרֽ⁠וֹ (1)
**To delight** in doing something means to be glad to do something or to want to do something. Alternate translation: “the king is doing this because he really wants to honor this man” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 6:12
## uri5
### אָבֵ֖ל וַ⁠חֲפ֥וּי רֹֽאשׁ (1)
People often covered their heads to show that they were either extremely sad or ashamed. Alternate translation: “covering his head because he felt completely disgraced” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

# 6:13
## j3d1
### וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֨ר הָמָ֜ן (1)
The implication is that, just as Haman gathered his friends together in [5:10](../05/10.md) to boast of his status, now he gathered them together once again to talk about what had just happened. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Haman brought all his friends together again. He told … ” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aca1
### כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר קָרָ֑⁠הוּ (1)
The implication is that he told about the things that had happened to him “that day.” If that would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aca2
### וַ⁠יֹּ֩אמְרוּ֩ ל֨⁠וֹ חֲכָמָ֜י⁠ו וְ⁠זֶ֣רֶשׁ (1)
The implication is that, just as King Ahasuerus had royal advisors, Haman had advisors of his own. They would have been included among the “friends” he gathered for this occasion. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “some of his friends were also his advisors, and they and his wife Zeresh told him” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aca3
### חֲכָמָ֜י⁠ו (1)
See how you translated this expression in [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: “his advisors”

## fd5k
### אִ֣ם & מָרְדֳּכַ֞י אֲשֶׁר֩ הַחִלּ֨וֹתָ לִ⁠נְפֹּ֤ל לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙ (1)
This could mean either of two possibilities: (1) The action of falling could refer to bowing down and it could be a metaphor meaning to be dishonored and defeated. Haman wanted Mordecai to bow down in front of him. But instead, the story would be saying that Haman is starting to bow down (in a metaphorical sense) in front of Mordecai. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to humiliate you. If he … ” (2) “Fall” could be a figurative way of saying “be killed in battle.” In that case, Zeresh would be comparing Haman and Mordecai to two soldiers who are fighting. She is saying that Haman has already “begun to fall,” that is, he is losing the battle, and he is likely to be killed. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to defeat you. Since he … ” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j3d3
### לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase either means (1) that Haman has already begun to fall down (bow down) in front of Mordecai figuratively, or (2) that Haman and Mordecai are facing one another figuratively in hand-to-hand combat. Alternate translation: “before whom” or “in whose presence” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## p5t2
### מִ⁠זֶּ֣רַע הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֡ים (1)
Here, **seed** is a metaphor meaning “offspring.” It is a comparison: Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “one of the Jewish people” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## nan5
### לֹא־תוּכַ֣ל ל֔⁠וֹ (1)
Here Haman’s wife and friends are again speaking figuratively as if Haman is in a battle with Mordecai. Alternate translation: “you will not win against him” or “you will not have greater honor than he has” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j3d5
### כִּֽי (1)
This conjunction indicates a contrast between the actions of prevailing (in the previous clause) and falling. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## j3d7
### נָפ֥וֹל תִּפּ֖וֹל (1)
Here the action of **falling** (1) either refers once again to prostrating oneself, and is a metaphor meaning to be dishonored and defeated, or (2) Haman’s wife and friends are saying that for Haman, defeat will be the outcome of the figurative battle. Alternate translation: “you will certainly lose to him” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j3d9
### לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that Haman will lose in his struggle with Mordecai. Alternate translation: “before him” or “in his presence” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 6:14
## j4d1
### עוֹדָ⁠ם֙ מְדַבְּרִ֣ים עִמּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
This phrase indicates something that happened after Haman’s wife and friends started talking with Haman and while they were still talking. You should indicate this with a phrase such as “while.” Alternate translation: “while they were still talking together, the king’s eunuchs arrived” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-background]])

## aca4
### וְ⁠סָרִיסֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ (1)
See how you decided to translate this term in [1:10](../01/10.md). Not all of the king’s eunuchs came. This can be stated explicitly. Alternate translation: “some of the king’s servants” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## aca5
### וַ⁠יַּבְהִ֨לוּ֙ לְ⁠הָבִ֣יא אֶת־הָמָ֔ן (1)
Alternative translation: “they wanted to bring Haman quickly”

## aca6
### אֲשֶׁר־עָשְׂתָ֥ה אֶסְתֵּֽר (1)

### וַ⁠יָּבֹ֤א הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ וְ⁠הָמָ֔ן לִ⁠שְׁתּ֖וֹת עִם־אֶסְתֵּ֥ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּֽה (1)
Esther hosted Ahasuerus and Haman for more than just drinks. This is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. An entire banquet is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “so the king and Haman went to the second banquet that Queen Esther had prepared” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

# 7:2
## xt9f
### בַּ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִי֙ (1)

## s5ae
### בְּ⁠מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן (1)
Alternate translation: “while they were drinking wine” or “while the servants were pouring the wine and giving it to them”

## yks7
### מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ & וְ⁠תִנָּ֣תֵֽן לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ (1)
These two statements mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is truly disposed to giving Esther what she wants. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “now please tell me what you really want. Tell me, and I will do it for you” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## p1xt
### מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ (1)
Ahasuerus has now allowed Esther to show her hospitality at two banquets. But he knows that she has done this as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship, and that this signals that she has an important and urgent request to make. You can indicate this by having the king ask, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## sem7
### וְ⁠תִנָּ֣תֵֽן & וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ (1)
You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you what you ask for” or “I will do for you what you ask” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## j4d3
### שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ & בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ (1)
The two abstract nouns **petition** and **request** can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## j4d5
### עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת (1)
See how you translated this expression in [5:3](../05/03.md) and [5:6](../05/06.md). Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

# 7:3
## ac96
### וַ⁠תַּ֨עַן & וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֔ר (1)
Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## k27c
### אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ (1)
**Favor** means the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## aca7
### אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## j4d7
### הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
In this case, Esther is addressing Ahasuerus directly as “O king”; she is not speaking about him in the third person as a sign of respect, as she and others usually do elsewhere in the story. This may indicate a special urgency to what she is saying, so it would be good to include this difference in your translation or indicate the urgency in some other way.

## aca8
### וְ⁠אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב (1)
This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](../01/19.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), [5:4](../05/04.md), and [5:8](../05/08.md). The suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good plan to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But here, Esther has just addressed the king directly with “O king” and she is pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people. So an alternate translation here could be something more like, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## aca9
### תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙ בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י בְּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י (1)
The phrases **at my petition** and **at my request** mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the urgency of the request. If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine the two requests. Alternate translation: “please spare my life and save my people” or “my request is that you spare my life and the lives of my people” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## j4d9
### תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙ (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “please spare my life” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## bvi1
### בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י (1)
The abstract noun **petition** can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “that is what I am asking for” or “that is what I want” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## qghp
### וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י (1)
If this is unclear in your language, you can repeat from the previous clause the words that have been left out. Alternate translation: “and let my people be given to me”
(See: [[figs-ellipsis]])

## j5d1
### בְּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י (1)
The abstract noun **request** can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “rhat is what I am asking for” or “rhat is what I want” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 7:4
## acb1
### כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙ (1)
As Esther points out later in the verse, the Jews actually have not been exchanged for money. Rather, **sell** is a figurative way of saying “turn over to.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning by saying something like “For someone has turned us over to our enemies.” Alternatively, you could use the same figure, but show that it is a comparison. Alternate translation: “it is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## fhs7
### כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙ (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “for someone has sold us” or “for someone has put us in danger of our enemies” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## e9cx
### לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֖יד לַ⁠הֲר֣וֹג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֑ד (1)
As in [3:13](../03/13.md), these words mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. If using three words would be difficult or confusing in your language, you can use one word for this and indicate that the destruction is extreme. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## yg01
### לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֖יד לַ⁠הֲר֣וֹג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֑ד (1)
If your language does not use abstract nouns such as these, you can replace them with one or more verbs. Alternate translation: “and they are going to kill every one of us” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## acb2
### וְ֠⁠אִלּוּ לַ⁠עֲבָדִ֨ים וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁפָח֤וֹת נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙ (1)
Alternate translation: “if the men and even the women had been sold into slavery”

## j5d3
### אֵ֥ין הַ⁠צָּ֛ר שֹׁוֶ֖ה בְּ⁠נֵ֥זֶק הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Esther is speaking very deferentially and with some exaggeration in order to impress on the king how important this is to her. She is saying that it would have been worth less to her to see her people rescued from slavery than it would have been to see the king spared the trouble of intervening on their behalf. (Haman uses the expression of “not equal” in this same sense in [5:13](../05/13.md).) Alternate translation: “that would have been a matter too small to bother you with” or “that would be a small matter to a king like you, but this is very much worse” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## acb4
### הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Esther addresses King Ahasuerus in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[figs-123person]])

# 7:5
## acb5
### וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ & וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר (1)
These two words mean the same thing. Alternate translation: “responded” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## acb6
### מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. They both ask about the identity of the man who is trying to destroy the Jews. King Ahasuerus uses the repetition to emphasize how outraged he is. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two phrases. However, from another perspective, both the man’s identity and his location are important to know so that his plot can be stopped. So, for that reason, you could also decide to include both phrases in your translation. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## acb7
### מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא (1)
Alternate translation: “who has done this”

## dl4b
### וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא אֲשֶׁר־מְלָא֥⁠וֹ לִבּ֖⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת כֵּֽן (1)
Here the concept of a **full heart** uses two metaphors at once. “Heart” figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. Also, saying that the “heart” is “full” is a figurative way of saying that someone is fully intending to do something, usually something that should not be done. Alternate translation: “where is the man who is intending to do such a thing” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 7:6
## j5d5
### צַ֣ר וְ⁠אוֹיֵ֔ב (1)
These words mean the same thing. Together, they emphasize Haman’s complete hostility towards the Jews. If it is more natural in your language, you can combine them and indicate the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: “the one who is our absolute nemesis” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## ar4f
### נִבְעַ֔ת (1)
Alternative translation: “was extremely afraid”

## j5d9
### נִבְעַ֔ת מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֥י (1)
Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that Haman was now extremely afraid to be in the presence of King Ahasuerus and Queen Esther. Alternate translation: “this made Haman very afraid to be in the presence of the king and the queen” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 7:7
## bzd4
### וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ קָ֤ם בַּ⁠חֲמָת⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠מִּשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן (1)
Here, **in his rage** is an idiom meaning to be extremely angry. Alternate translation: “the king was extremely angry and got up” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## j6d1
### אֶל־גִּנַּ֖ת הַ⁠בִּיתָ֑ן (1)
The implication is that Ahasuerus went outside to absorb the shock that a man he had promoted to the highest position in his empire was plotting to destroy his queen and her whole people. Ahasuerus needed to sort out his conflicting loyalties and decide what to do about this. If it is clearer, you can say explicitly why he went outside. Alternate translation: “he went outside to the palace garden to decide what to do.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## uaq6
### לְ⁠בַקֵּ֤שׁ עַל־נַפְשׁ⁠וֹ֙ (1)
Here, **seeking** figuratively means to beg or plead urgently for something. This phrase means that Haman wanted to beg Esther to persuade the king not to order his execution. Alternate translation: “to plead with Queen Esther to spare his life” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## qz1m
### כִּ֣י רָאָ֔ה (1)
Here, **seeing** is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “he realized” or “he understood” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## nin1
### כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the king had decided to cause a disaster against him” or “the king was decided to destroy him” or “the king had decided to kill him” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## j6d3
### כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ (1)
Here the abstract noun **evil** means “harm,” not something that is morally wrong as in the previous verse. In this context, it can be expressed with a verb such as “execute.” Alternate translation: “the king was likely to execute him” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 7:8
## j6d5
### וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ שָׁב֩ & וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל (1)
The implication is that when the king returned to the room, he saw what this verse describes next. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the king returned … , he saw that Haman had fallen … ” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## h4c7
### וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ (1)
The implication is that Haman was doing this as he pleaded for his life. If it would be clearer in your language, you can add that information to the end of this phrase: “ … as he was begging Esther to spare his life” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acb8
### וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ (1)
If you prefer to present the events in chronological order, you can put this information first in the verse. See the UST. (See: [[figs-events]])

## acb9
### וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ (1)
The expression **was fallen** means that as Haman was begging for his life, he was not standing up; he had suddenly come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a couch. (From the impression that the king got when he returned, it is possible that Haman was even grabbing her arms or shoulders as he pleaded with Esther.) Alternate translation: “Haman had come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a banqueting couch” or “Haman had thrown himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining”
(See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acc0
### הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ (1)
In this culture, especially at a banquet like this one, wealthy people would recline on couches as they ate and drank. Alternate translation: “Esther’s banqueting couch”

## thq6
### הֲ֠⁠גַם לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת (1)
The king phrases this as a question to show his shock and anger at what he thinks Haman is doing. If it is clearer in your language, you can phrase it as
a statement. Alternate translation: “he is even trying to rape the queen” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## l4ce
### לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה (1)
The story is using a mild expression to refer to something that is disturbing. In this context, “subdue” means “rape.” The king thought that Haman was trying to rape Esther, and he likely said just that. You can show this in your translation if you want to make this clear. Alternate translation: “trying to rape the queen” (See: [[figs-euphemism]])

## acc1
### עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea that they are expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. However, each one does indicate something slightly different about what a serious offense it would be if Haman actually were trying to rape Esther. It would be a violation of the king’s personal trust and a violation of the trust implicit in hospitality. So you can also include both phrases. Alternate translation: “in my presence and in my own house” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## adq6
### הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר יָצָא֙ מִ⁠פִּ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
This expression describes the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “as soon as the king said this” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acc2
### הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר & וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ (1)
The king spoke, and then the servants covered Haman’s face. One action followed upon another. However, this happened so quickly that almost no time seemed to pass in between. You can indicate this with a phrase like “as soon as.” Alternate translation: “when the king said this, immediately they covered Haman’s face” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-background]])

## j6d9
### וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ (1)
The implication is that some the king’s servants who were present did this, and they did it because they understood that the king wanted Haman to be executed. Alternate translation: “some of his servants covered Haman’s face because he was going to be executed” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acc3
### וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ (1)
**Covering the face** in this culture, as in many others, was a sign that a person had been condemned to death. Alternate translation: “some of his servants covered Haman’s face to show that he would be executed” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

# 7:9

## acc4
### הַ⁠סָּרִיסִ֜ים לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)

## j7d3
### הִנֵּה (1)
**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, it can be omitted from your translation. But consider using an expression that is natural in your language for someone to address the king directly to get his attention. For example, you could say, “O king!”

## acc5
### גַּ֣ם & הָ⁠עֵ֣ץ אֲשֶׁר־עָשָׂ֪ה הָמָ֟ן לְֽ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֞י & עֹמֵד֙ בְּ⁠בֵ֣ית הָמָ֔ן (1)
Alternate translation:“Haman has also set up a pole [or gallows] at his house because he wants to impale [or hang] Mordecai on it”

## j7d5
### הָ⁠עֵ֣ץ (1)
See how you translated this term in [2:23](../02/23.md), [5:14](../05/14.md), and [6:4](../06/04.md). Review the note to [2:23](../02/23.md) if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “wooden pole” or “gallows” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

### לְֽ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֞י אֲשֶׁ֧ר דִּבֶּר־ט֣וֹב עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)
This expression means that Mordecai said something that benefitted the king. Specifically, Mordecai reported an assassination plot and saved the king’s life. Alternate translation: “Mordecai, who saved the king’s life.” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## j7d9
### דִּבֶּר־ט֣וֹב עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ (1)
Harbona addresses the king in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “saved your life” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## sre1
### גָּבֹ֖הַּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אַמָּ֑ה (1)

## acc7
### תְּלֻ֥⁠הוּ עָלָֽי⁠ו (1)
**Him** means Haman. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “hang [or impale] Haman on it” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 7:10
## j8d3
### הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ (1)
As in the previous verse, this refers to a wooden pole or gallows. See how you translated the term there. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## umd4
### וַ⁠חֲמַ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שָׁכָֽכָה (1)
Here the story figuratively compares the king’s anger to floodwaters, which can cause great destruction. “Subside” means for waters to drain away and for their level to go down. You could express the meaning by saying something like “Then the king’s rage lessened,” or “Then the king was not so angry.” Or you could use a different metaphor that would be meaningful in your language, such as, “Then the king cooled off.” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 8:intro
## z6j7

# 8:1
## j8d5
### בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֗וּא (1)
This could mean one of three things: (1) A new series of events is now being described, but the story makes clear that they happened on the same day as the second banquet. While it must have been some time later in the day, the idea is that when Haman lost his life, and also his property, Esther gained what her enemy had lost. Alternate translation: “that same day” (2) The expression could also be an idiom that means “as of that day.” This would refer to the effective date for the transfer of Haman’s property to Esther. Alternate translation: “as of that day” (3) The term “day” could also be used figuratively to mean around the same time. (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## j8d7
### נָתַ֞ן הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֣ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית הָמָ֖ן (1)
Here, **house** figuratively represents all the household and property of Haman. The story could be referring to all the property by naming one part of it, the house. Or “house” could be a metonym for “property,” meaning everything a person owns and keeps in their house, and by extension everything they own beyond the house as well. Alternate translation: “King Ahasuerus declared that everything that Haman had owned would now belong to Queen Esther” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## nm3u
### צֹרֵ֣ר הַיְּהוּדִ֑ים (1)
This phrase gives clarifying information about Haman. Alternate translation: “the enemy of the Jews” (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

## acc9
### וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֗י בָּ֚א לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
The implication is that when the king learned how Mordecai was related to Esther, he summoned Mordecai into his presence. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when he learned that, the king sent for Mordecai to come into his presence” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j8d9
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. This phrase indicates that Mordecai was allowed to come into the king’s presence. Alternate translation: “into his presence” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## acd0
### הִגִּ֥ידָה אֶסְתֵּ֖ר מַ֥ה הוּא־לָֽ⁠הּ (1)
Alternate translation: “Esther told the king how Mordecai was related to her” You can say this before saying that the king summoned Mordecai, since it happened first. See the UST.
(See: [[figs-events]])

## j9d1
### הִגִּ֥ידָה אֶסְתֵּ֖ר מַ֥ה הוּא־לָֽ⁠הּ (1)
Esther told this to the king. She would likely have explained not just how she and Mordecai were related, but that he had raised her after her parents died. You can say this if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Esther told the king that Mordecai was her cousin and that he had been like a father to her” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 8:2
## m5hz
### וַ⁠יָּ֨סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֗⁠וֹ & וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י (1)
Giving the ring to Mordecai showed that Mordecai could now act on the king’s own authority, and it enabled him to do that. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king now gave this ring to Mordecai to show that Mordecai had the power to act on the authority of the king” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## acd1
### טַבַּעְתּ֗⁠וֹ (1)
See how you translated this in [3:10](../03/10.md). Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the ring that had his official seal on it” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## j9d3
### אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן (1)
This means that the king had taken back his signet ring from Haman. He would have done this when he sentenced Haman to death. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “the king had given Haman the ring that had his official seal on it, but he had taken it back from Haman when he sentenced Haman to death, and the king was wearing it again.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acd2
### אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן (1)
If it is clearer in your language, you can put this information first in the verse because it happened before everything else. (See: [[figs-events]])

## z5yn
### וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י (1)
By giving his signet ring to Mordecai, the king gave Mordecai the authority to write important papers that people would have to obey. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. See the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acd3
### וַ⁠תָּ֧שֶׂם אֶסְתֵּ֛ר אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֖י עַל־בֵּ֥ית הָמָֽן (1)

## d2tj
### בֵּ֥ית הָמָֽן (1)
See the explanation of this phrase in verse 1. Alternate translation: “everything that Haman had owned” or “the household of Haman” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 8:3
## j9d5
### וַ⁠תּ֣וֹסֶף אֶסְתֵּ֗ר וַ⁠תְּדַבֵּר֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Here the exact meaning of the progression of verbs is uncertain, but this verse probably begins a new event in the story separate from what happened in the previous verse. Alternate translation: “then Esther again spoke in the king’s presence” (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## j9d7
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “while she was in his presence” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## j9d9
### וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Here, **falling** is an idiom referring to the action of bowing down or prostrating oneself, and **face** figuratively represents the front of a person, place, or object. Alternate translation: “and she bowed down” or “and she prostrated herself” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acd4
### וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו (1)
This may actually mean that Esther put her face right on top of the feet of King Ahasuerus. This would have been an act of humility and desperation by which she showed that her need was very great and that she believed the king had great power to help her. (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## acd5
### וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Esther’s action was probably a recognized sign of pleading in this culture. However, it would likely still have been remarkable for a queen to fall at the feet of her husband, the king. You can show this by introducing the information with a phrase like “in fact.” Alternate translation: “in fact, to show how desperately she was pleading, Esther got down and put her face right on top of his feet” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j1r1
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Here, **face** is a metonym meaning the front of a person, place, or object. This phrase means that Esther prostrated herself in front of the feet of King Ahasuerus. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

Here, **the evil** refers to Haman’s plan.
This expression means to prevent a wrong action from happening.
Alternate translation: “to stop the evil plan of Haman the Agagite” or “to prevent the evil things from happening that Haman the Agagite had planned”
(See: [[figs-idiom]])

## bp22

## xh24
### וַ⁠יּ֤וֹשֶׁט הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֔ר אֵ֖ת שַׁרְבִ֣ט הַ⁠זָּהָ֑ב (1)
As in [5:2](../05/02.md), King Ahasuerus did this to show that Esther had his favor. In that earlier episode, this indicated that he would not enforce the law that said Esther should be executed for coming into the inner court without being summoned. But since Esther was apparently already in the king’s presence on this occasion, it seems that the gesture could also be used generally to show that the king was positively disposed towards a person and would grant the person’s request. Alternate translation: “the king held out his golden scepter to Esther” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## acd7
### שַׁרְבִ֣ט הַ⁠זָּהָ֑ב (1)
See how you translated this in [4:11](../04/11.md). If it would be helpful, review the explanation of what this object was. Alternate translation: “golden scepter” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב & וְ⁠כָשֵׁ֤ר הַ⁠דָּבָר֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king will think that her suggestion is a good idea and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if what I am going to suggest seems like a good idea to you” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## r2yy
### וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו & וְ⁠טוֹבָ֥ה אֲנִ֖י בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו (1)
These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying very deferentially that she hopes that the king is positively disposed towards her, that he thinks well of her, and will, therefore, grant her request. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## acd9
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו (1)
Here Esther addresses the king throughout in the third person as a way of showing respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-123person]])

## ace0
### אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב (1)
This is an idiom that also appears in [1:19](../01/19.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), [5:4](../05/04.md), and [5:8](../05/08.md). A suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But in another place, [7:3](../07/03.md), when Esther was pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people, the suggested alternate translation was, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask” Here, Esther is also pleading, so you could use that phrase here in your translation as well. Alternate translation: “if what I ask for seems right in the king’s evaluation” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## ftc7
### וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן (1)
This expression also appears many times in the story. It means to gain the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## j1r7
### לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו & לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Here, **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. These phrases could mean “as I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring figuratively to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Esther’s request would become evident in his face first, so it would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## xci7
### בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and I please you” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j1r9
### יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים (1)
The first letters that told of the plan to destroy the Jews would not be brought back to Susa physically. Rather, **bring back** is an idiom that means “cancel” or “revoke.” Alternate translation: “make a new law to cancel what Haman decreed” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## nbk3
### יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים (1)
You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “write a new letter” or “make a new law” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 8:6
## j2r5
### כִּ֠י (1)
Here Esther is giving the reason why she is asking King Ahasuerus to revoke the letters. Alternate translation: “the reason I am asking is that” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

Esther is actually making a statement, but she expresses herself in question form to show how strongly she feels about what she is saying. She does not actually expect the king to tell her how she could bear seeing her people destroyed. Alternate translation: “I cannot bear to see disaster fall on the Jews” or “I cannot endure watching my relatives be killed” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## ace1
### אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י וְ⁠אֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י (1)
These two sentences mean basically the same thing. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is saying. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I could not bear to see my relatives and my whole people destroyed” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## ace2
### בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י (1)
Even though it was morally very wrong for Haman to want to destroy Mordecai’s whole people, here the abstract noun **evil** likely means “harm,” as in [7:7](../07/07.md). It means the same thing as “destruction” in the next sentence. Alternate translation: “my people being destroyed” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## ace3
### יִמְצָ֣א (1)
As in [1:5](../01/05.md), **find** is an idiom that means something exists in a certain place or time, not that people were looking for it and located it. Esther is speaking of the harm that will exist for the Jews if the effect of Haman’s letters is not undone. Alternate translation: “would be destroyed” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## ace4
### בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן (1)
This abstract noun can be expressed with a verb such as “destroyed.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## ace5
### מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י (1)
Alternate translation: “my relatives”

# 8:7
## j2r7
### הִנֵּ֨ה (1)
This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”

## ace6
### בֵית־הָמָ֜ן נָתַ֣תִּי לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֗ר (1)
See the note about this expression in [8:1](../08/01.md). Alternate translation: “I have given Esther all the property that belonged to Haman” or “I have given Esther the household of Haman”

## h44h
### בֵית־הָמָ֜ן (1)
Here, **house** is a metonym meaning the entire household of Haman. Alternate translation: “the household of Haman” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## ace7
### וְ⁠אֹת⁠וֹ֙ תָּל֣וּ עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ (1)
Alternate translation: “I had my servants impale Haman on a wooden pole” or “I had my servants hang Haman on a gallows” You can put this information first because it happened before the king gave Haman’s property to Esther. (See: [[figs-events]])

## ace8
### הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ (1)
See how you translated this term in [2:23](../02/23.md), [5:14](../05/14.md), [6:4](../06/04.md), [7:9](../07/09.md), and [7:10](../07/10.md). Review the note to

## j2r9
### שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֖⁠וֹ (1)
Here the expression \*\*to stretch out a hand\*\* means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. Alternate translation: “because he plotted to destroy all the Jews” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 8:8
## acf0
### וְ֠⁠אַתֶּם (1)

## j3r1
### כַּ⁠טּ֤וֹב בְּ⁠עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙ (1)
Here, **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that Esther and Mordecai have permission to write what they think is best. Alternate translation: “as you think is best” or “what you think is best” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j3mn
### בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
Here, **name** is a metaphor meaning authority. This phrase means Esther and Mordecai have permission to write with the authority of the King Ahasuerus. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## acf2
### בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ (1)
King Ahasuerus refers to himself in the third person. You can have him say this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I give you permission to write with my own authority” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## j3r3
### בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)

## acf3
### בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ (1)

## j3r5
### כִּֽי (1)
Here, King Ahasuerus is expressing the reason why he cannot simply revoke the first letter and also why Esther and Mordecai can write another letter that people must obey. Alternate translation: “you see” or “people will obey your letter because” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## acf4
### אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב (1)

## acf5
### כְתָ֞ב & אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you can put this first in the verse because it explains why Ahasuerus answers Esther and Mordecai in the way that he does. See the UST.

## acf6
### כְתָ֞ב אֲשֶׁר־נִכְתָּ֣ב בְּ⁠שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠נַחְתּ֛וֹם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֥עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ (1)
The king is describing a general situation, but he has Haman’s letter specifically in mind. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Haman wrote his letter with my authority, and he sealed it with the ring that has my official seal on it. No one can revoke a letter like that” (The story explained in [1:19](../01/19.md) that the king’s laws could not be changed once they had been made and proclaimed.) (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 8:9
## acf7
### וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ (1)
This indicates that what is described in this verse was done because of what the king said in the previous verse. Use a connecting word or phrase to show this in your language. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “the king called his scribes” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## acf8
### וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ (1)
If you use an expression such as “called,” make sure your readers will understand that the king likely sent an official to go and bring the scribes back with him. The king did not call out in a loud voice to get them to come.

## j4r1
### בַּ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֜י (1)
Alternate translation: “in month three” (See: [[translate-ordinal]])

## acf9
### בַּ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֜י (1)
Alternate translation: “in the third month of the year” It would still be the same year as in [3:7](../03/07.md), the twelfth year that Ahasuerus reigned as king of Persia. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j356

## acg2
### אֶל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֡ים (1)
It appears from verse 11 that the letter would have been addressed specifically to the Jews in the empire, telling them that the king had authorized them to defend themselves. But copies were also sent to all the royal and provincial officials. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “the letter addressed the Jews in the empire, but copies were also sent” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

### וְ⁠אֶ֣ל הָ⁠אֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִֽים־וְ⁠הַ⁠פַּחוֹת֩ וְ⁠שָׂרֵ֨י הַ⁠מְּדִינ֜וֹת (1)
See how you translated these terms in [3:12](../03/12.md), where they were used to describe who received Haman’s letter. These are all people in government positions. The first one is the governor of the province and the other two are rulers under him who govern cities or smaller areas. If your language uses one term for all of these, you could use that with a descriptive phrase such as “to the government leaders of each province and also to the leaders under him.”

The Jews would have been included among all the people groups in the empire in the phrase “people by people.” So this seems to be saying, “and especially to the Jews.” Verse 11 explains that it was particularly important for the Jews to read the letter because it gave them the right to defend themselves. Alternate translation: “they wrote especially to the Jews in their own script and in their own language”

# 8:10
## acg5
### וַ⁠יִּכְתֹּ֗ב & וַ⁠יַּחְתֹּ֖ם (1)

It is likely that the messengers only published the news in the cities and not the entire countryside, but the news was certainly intended for everyone, not only people living in the cities.

The implication seems to be that the Jews were glad to do what Mordecai had instructed, because they had already been doing it. You can add a word such as “readily” to indicate this. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## aco8
### וְ⁠קִבֵּל֙ (1)
Alternate translation: “agreed”

## ib25
### אֲשֶׁר־הֵחֵ֖לּוּ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֑וֹת (1)
Alternate translation: “the Jews were already celebrating those days that way.” You can put this information first, to present the events in logical and chronological order. (See: [[figs-events]])

# 9:24
## j119
### כִּי֩ (1)
This introduces the reason for the events previously described. The story will now summarize everything that happened previously. The Jews were to celebrate because they were able to fight back when Haman plotted to destroy all of them. Alternate translation: “they would celebrate these days to remember” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## kqf6
### כִּי֩ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you can say here what this reason is explaining. Alternate translation: “they would establish those days as a holiday in order to remember how” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j125
### צֹרֵר֙ כָּל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים (1)

## xz7s
### וְ⁠הִפִּ֥יל פּוּר֙ ה֣וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֔ל (1)
You can say explicitly why Haman did this. Alternate translation: “he threw Pur (that is, he threw lots) to find out what would be the best day” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## bcy2
### פּוּר֙ ה֣וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֔ל (1)
As in 3:7, the storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and then the name for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. Alternate translation: “a Pur (that is, a lot)” (See: [[translate-names]])

## j127
### לְ⁠הֻמָּ֖⁠ם וּֽ⁠לְ⁠אַבְּדָֽ⁠ם (1)
The terms **vex** and **destroy** mean basically the same thing. They are used together to emphasize the degree to which Haman’s deadly plans were distressing to the Jews. If it would be clearer in your language, you can combine the terms and express the emphasis with a word like “completely.” Alternate translation: “and completely destroy them” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

# 9:25
## m8x3
### וּ⁠בְ⁠בֹאָ⁠הּ֮ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒ (1)
In this summary, many details are communicated implicitly. **She** means Esther. Also, this verse continues the account of what this celebration is commemorating.
If it would be clearer in your language, you can make these things explicit. Alternate translation: “the celebration also commemorated how Esther dared to come into the king’s presence without being summoned, and she won his favor” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j128
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒ (1)

## acp1
### אָמַ֣ר עִם־הַ⁠סֵּ֔פֶר (1)

## y57b
### יָשׁ֞וּב מַחֲשַׁבְתּ֧⁠וֹ הָ⁠רָעָ֛ה אֲשֶׁר־חָשַׁ֥ב עַל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֖ים עַל־רֹאשׁ֑⁠וֹ (1)
**His**, **he**, and **him** in this sentence refer to Haman. **Return on his head** is an idiom that means that what a person was planning to do to someone else happened to that person instead. Use an idiom with that meaning in your language. Alternate translation: “the wicked plan that Haman developed against the Jews will be done to him” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acp2
### וְ⁠תָל֥וּ אֹת֛⁠וֹ וְ⁠אֶת־בָּנָ֖י⁠ו עַל־הָ⁠עֵֽץ (1)
The letter itself did not say this. The story is summarizing the events in compressed form. It is speaking of the letter as if it were a person who could take action and give commands like this, but it was the king who gave the command. Alternate translation: “the king also ordered his servants to hang [or impale] Haman on a wooden pole [or hang Haman on a gallows]. When the Jews in Susa killed his ten sons, the king had their bodies hanged [or impaled] as well” (See: [[figs-personification]])

## j129
### הָ⁠עֵֽץ (1)
See how you translated this term in [2:23](../02/23.md) and its other occurrences. Review the explanation in the note to [2:23](../02/23.md) if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “wooden pole” or “gallows” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

# 9:26
## j131
### עַל־כֵּ֡ן (1)
This introduces the reason why the Jews gave the name “Purim” to this celebration. Alternate translation: “for that reason” or “that is why” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## acp3
### קָֽרְאוּ֩ לַ⁠יָּמִ֨ים הָ⁠אֵ֤לֶּה פוּרִים֙ (1)

## c1gi
### פוּרִים֙ (1)
This is the name of the festival that commemorates the salvation of the Jewish people in ancient Persia from Haman’s plot to destroy and kill all the Jews in a single day. (See: [[translate-names]])

## buf1
### עַל־שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠פּ֔וּר (1)
Alternate translation: “the Persian word for ‘lot’ is ‘Pur’” This is information that the original audience needed to understand how this celebration got its name. You can put this first in the verse because it explains what comes next. (See: [[writing-background]])

## yq8m
### שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠פּ֔וּר (1)
It can be stated clearly what “Pur” means. Alternate translation: “the word Pur, which means ‘lot’” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## j133
### עַל־כֵּ֕ן (1)
The story has just given the reason why the holiday is called Purim. Now it is going to give another reason. It will be explaining why the Jews added this holiday to their calendar, in addition to the festivals that were commanded in the Law of Moses. The next verse describes them adding the holiday. This verse gives the reasons why they did that. Alternate translation: “because” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## acp4
### עַל־כָּל־דִּבְרֵ֖י הָ⁠אִגֶּ֣רֶת הַ⁠זֹּ֑את (1)
This is a reference to the letter that Mordecai wrote, as described in verses 20–22. Alternate translation: “because Mordecai wrote to them to tell them to observe this holiday”

## acp5
### וּ⁠מָֽה־רָא֣וּ עַל־כָּ֔כָה וּ⁠מָ֥ה הִגִּ֖יעַ אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize what a vivid experience it was to live through the events that this story describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you can combine the phrases and express the emphasis with a word like “amazing.” Alternate translation: “the amazing things that had happened to them” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## acp6
### וּ⁠מָֽה־רָא֣וּ עַל־כָּ֔כָה וּ⁠מָ֥ה הִגִּ֖יעַ אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם (1)
These phrases say generally “this” and “what,” but they are referring to the specific events the story has related. If it would be clearer in your language, you can describe these things specifically. Alternate translation: “because the Jews had been able to destroy the enemies who had wanted to destroy them” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acp7
### וּ⁠מָֽה־רָא֣וּ עַל־כָּ֔כָה וּ⁠מָ֥ה הִגִּ֖יעַ אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם (1)
You can put this first, before the information about Mordecai’s letter, because it happened first. You can say “then” when you tell about the letter. (See: [[figs-events]])

## j135
### וּ⁠מָ֥ה הִגִּ֖יעַ אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם (1)
This expression means “what had happened to them.” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acp9
### קִיְּמ֣וּ וְקִבְּל֣וּ הַ⁠יְּהוּדִים֩ (1)

## j137
### וְ⁠עַל־זַרְעָ֜⁠ם (1)
As in [6:13](../06/13.md), **seed** is a metaphor meaning “offspring.” Alternate translation: “and for their descendants” or “and for their offspring” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## j141
### וְ⁠לֹ֣א יַעֲב֔וֹר (1)
This expression means that the Jews would never stop celebrating the feast of Purim every year. You can put this last since it applies to the whole verse. Alternate translation: “always” or “forever” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## acq0
### לִ⁠הְי֣וֹת עֹשִׂ֗ים אֵ֣ת שְׁנֵ֤י הַ⁠יָּמִים֙ הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה (1)

### וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ֠⁠אֵלֶּה נִזְכָּרִ֨ים וְ⁠נַעֲשִׂ֜ים (1)
This gives the result of the reasons described in verses 26 and 27. Alternate translation: “therefore” or “that is why” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## acq4
### וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ֠⁠אֵלֶּה נִזְכָּרִ֨ים וְ⁠נַעֲשִׂ֜ים (1)
**Remembered** and **made** mean basically the same thing here. The repetition is used to emphasize that the Jews have been faithful in doing this. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like “So the Jews have celebrated these days.” Alternate translation: “therefore they said that they would remember and celebrate on those two days” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## hc8s
### וְ⁠הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ֠⁠אֵלֶּה נִזְכָּרִ֨ים וְ⁠נַעֲשִׂ֜ים (1)

## acq5
### מְדִינָ֥ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֖ה וְ⁠עִ֣יר וָ⁠עִ֑יר (1)
This could be a figure of speech that refers to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between those parts. Generally speaking, a province would be the largest division of the empire that would identify a person’s location, and a city would be the smallest. Particularly, since the Jews would continue to celebrate Purim after the Persian empire and its provinces no longer exist, you might choose to express the meaning of this figure of speech in a more general way. Alternate translation: “everywhere they have lived” (See: [[figs-merism]])

## j149
### מְדִינָ֥ה וּ⁠מְדִינָ֖ה (1)
This expression means “every province.” Alternate translation: “in every single
province” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## oc4c
### וּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֥י (1)
Since the Hebrew verb wrote is feminine singular, it means that the letter was from Esther. The mention of **Mordecai** here probably means that Mordecai helped her to write the letter. Alternate translation: “with Mordecai”

## acq8
### הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֖י (1)
This phrase gives information about Mordecai to remind the reader. (See: [[figs-distinguish]])

Alternate translation: “an additional letter about Purim with her authority” or (2) the second letter that Mordecai wrote (see verses 20-22), creating the festival of Purim. Alternate translation: “to confirm what Mordecai had written about Purim in his second letter” In either case, this letter from Esther is to add her royal authority to what Mordecai had already written. (See: [[translate-numbers]])

# 9:30
## acr1
### וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַ֨ח סְפָרִ֜ים (1)
While this says “**he**,” in context it refers to the letter that Esther wrote with Mordecai’s help. Alternate translation: “they sent copies of this second letter” or “Mordecai ordered messengers to take copies of the letter” (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

## acr2
### אֶל־כָּל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֗ים אֶל־שֶׁ֨בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה מַלְכ֖וּת אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ (1)
These three phrases all mean the same thing. The repetition emphasizes that Esther and Mordecai sent this second letter out comprehensively throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “to all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Ahasuerus” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## acr3
### שֶׁ֨בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה (1)
The letter was not sent to the provinces as geographical territories, but to the Jews who lived in them. The Jews are being described by something associated with them, the places where they lived. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## u389
### שֶׁ֨בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה (1)

Alternate translation: “with a message that assured them of their peaceful and stable situation”

# 9:31

This is referring to background information that the original audience would have known. They would have known what the fasting was about. It could be either: (1) fasting as a part of Purim. We know that some Jews fasted on the 13th day of the month of Adar to commemorate the day that Haman intended to destroy them, or (2) other times of fasting. Ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews had been fasting and mourning in the fifth month of the year to show their sorrow over what had happened. (The story refers to the Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in [2:6](../02/06.md).) You could put this information in a footnote if it would help your readers to understand this.

## rl2s
### וְ⁠עַל־זַרְעָ֑⁠ם (1)

## acr8
### עַל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם (1)
The purpose of this chapter is to describe the greatness of Mordecai. It does that by showing that he was second in command to a very powerful emperor. Referring to both the land and the sea is a way to include everything that lives in a very large area of the earth. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like “everyone throughout his empire.” Alternate translation: “on all the people in the empire … even the people who lived on the islands in the Mediterranean Sea” or “on everyone throughout the land and even the far-away islands” (See: [[figs-merism]])

## twn8
### וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם (1)
The phrase **the islands of the sea** likely refers to the fact that the Persian kings had conquered territories reaching all the way to the Mediterranean Sea. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “which reached all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## acr9
### עַל־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠אִיֵּ֥י הַ⁠יָּֽם (1)
These geographic features were not expected to pay the tax. The land and coastlands represent the people living there. The story is describing those people figuratively by reference to something associated with them, the places where they live. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 10:2
## acs1
### וְ⁠כָל־מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה תָקְפּ⁠וֹ֙ וּ⁠גְב֣וּרָת֔⁠וֹ (1)
**Power** and **might** mean essentially the same thing. They are used together to emphasize how powerful King Ahasuerus was. If it is more natural in your language, you can use one word with that meaning, with another word that gives it emphasis. Alternate translation: “all that he achieved because of how very powerful he was” or “all the great things that he did because of his great power” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## p98n

### דֹּרֵ֥שׁ טוֹב֙ לְ⁠עַמּ֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠דֹבֵ֥ר שָׁל֖וֹם לְ⁠כָל־זַרְעֽ⁠וֹ (1)

If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like, “He worked hard so his people and their descendants would prosper.” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## act3
### דֹּרֵ֥שׁ טוֹב֙ לְ⁠עַמּ֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠דֹבֵ֥ר שָׁל֖וֹם לְ⁠כָל־זַרְעֽ⁠וֹ (1)
The abstract nouns **good** and **peace** refer in this context to prosperity and security. You could translate these ideas with verbs, for example, you could say, “He worked hard to make sure that his people would prosper and their descendants would be secure.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

Here, **seed** figuratively means “descendants.” Even if you combine the two parallel phrases, you can still convey the idea of “down through the generations” with a word such as “always.” Alternate translation: “and for their descendants” or “and for their offspring” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])
