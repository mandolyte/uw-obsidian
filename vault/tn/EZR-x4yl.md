# General Information:

This word indicates that the events the story will now relate came after the event it has just described, that is, after the identification of all the people who would be traveling to Jerusalem with Ezra. If it would be clearer in your language, you could show this relationship by using a word such as “Then.” (See: [[grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
