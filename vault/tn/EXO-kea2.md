# Exodus 05 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### A slave’s work
The Egyptians were known for making their slaves do a lot of work. The Israelite slaves were forced to make a specific number of bricks every day. In this chapter, they were required not only to make these bricks, but also to gather straw, one of the raw materials, in order to make these bricks.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### “Let my people go”
This is a very important statement. Moses does not seek permission to leave, asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he demands that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

### Titles
The leaders are given different titles in this chapter. The ULT uses “taskmasters” and “foremen.” Many cultures will not have these types of titles. Generic expressions like “Egyptian leaders” and “Hebrew leaders” may be necessary.
