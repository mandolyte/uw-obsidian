## Special concepts in this chapter

### “I adjure you”

With these words Paul challenges Timothy in the most serious way possible to do what he is telling him to do. It is a way of commanding Timothy, not by Paul’s own authority, but by the authority that he then refers to, that of God and Jesus Christ. In other words, Paul is saying that God and Jesus Christ are commanding Timothy through Paul.

### Crown

Scripture uses the image of a crown to represent different things. In this chapter, Paul describes Christ as awarding a crown to believers as a metaphor for the reward that Christ will give them for having lived rightly on this earth.
