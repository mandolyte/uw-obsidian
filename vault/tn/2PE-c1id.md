# 2 Peter 03 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Fire
People often use fire to destroy things or to make something pure by burning off the dirt and worthless parts. Therefore when God punishes the wicked or purifies his people, it is often associated with fire. (See: [[../bible/other/fire]])

### Day of the Lord
The exact time of the coming day of the Lord will come as a surprise to people. This is what the simile “like a thief in the night” means. Because of this, Christians are to be prepared for the coming of the Lord. (See: [[../bible/kt/dayofthelord]] and [[figs-simile]])
