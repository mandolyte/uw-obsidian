# Exodus 02 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter


### Covenant
God begins to relate to the Israelites based on his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.


### Moses’ heritage
In the first part of this chapter, Pharaoh’s daughter recognizes Moses as being a Hebrew, but in the last part of this chapter, the Midianites believe him to be an Egyptian.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Identification of participants
- Moses is the only participant named in most of this chapter. This is because many of the participants play very minor roles and because this part of the story is focusing on Moses’ life.

### Ironic situations
- While Pharaoh tried to diminish the power of the Israelites by killing all of their baby boys, God used Pharaoh’s own daughter to save Moses.


- Moses believes he is meant to be the rescuer of his people, but they reject him. Ultimately, Moses was correct, but God had not yet sent him for that mission.
