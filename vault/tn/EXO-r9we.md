# Exodus 07 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Miracles
When Yahweh had Moses perform miracles, Pharaoh’s men were able to copy these miracles. It is unknown how they were able to do this, but since it was not from Yahweh, they were probably done under some evil power. (See: [[../bible/kt/miracle]] and [[../bible/kt/evil]])

### Pharaoh’s hard heart
Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard, strong, or heavy in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. 

### “Let my people go”
This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter include:
- Moses as God to Pharaoh
- A number of difficult terms: prophet, signs, wonders, miracles, sorcerers, magicians, magic, judgements, canals, reservoirs
- The use of “heart” to refer to the seat of will and emotion
- Up to third-level quotations
