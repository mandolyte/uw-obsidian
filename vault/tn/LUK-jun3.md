## Special concepts in this chapter

### “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit”

Jesus says in 12:10 that anyone who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven. This is a descriptive statement, not a prescriptive one. Jesus is not saying that if people happen to speak certain words, then God will refuse to forgive them, no matter how sorry they are afterwards. Rather, it is the Holy Spirit who brings conviction of sin and of the need to repent. “Blasphemy against the Holy Spirit” means attributing the influence of the Holy Spirit to evil powers, as the Pharisees did when they said in 11:15 that Jesus drove out demons by the power of Beelzebul, the ruler of demons. By definition, then, if a person thinks that the influence of the Holy Spirit is an evil influence, they will not respond to it, and so they will not experience conviction of sin, repent, and be forgiven. That is why people who “blaspheme against the Holy Spirit” will not be forgiven. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])

### Servants

God expects his people to remember that everything in the world belongs to God. God gives his people things so they can serve him. He wants them to please him by doing what he wants them to do with everything he has given them. One day Jesus will ask his servants what they have done with everything he gave them to use. He will give a reward to those who have done what he wanted them to do, and he will punish those who have not. Jesus teaches about this in 12:34-40.

### Division

Jesus knew that those who did not choose to follow him would hate those who did choose to follow him. He also knew that most people love their families more than they love anyone else. So he wanted his followers to understand that following and pleasing him had to be more important to them than having their family love them. Jesus teaches about this in 12:49-53.
