As Yahwehâ€™s chosen priests, the priest were to trust in Yahweh to provide for them. He provided for them through the rest of the Israelites. Yahweh was their inheritance. (See: [[../bible/kt/elect]], [[../bible/kt/priest]] and [[../bible/kt/trust]] and [[../bible/kt/inherit]])

### Messiah
This chapter is one of the first prophecies about the promised, coming Messiah. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]] and [[../bible/kt/promise]] and [[../bible/kt/christ]])
