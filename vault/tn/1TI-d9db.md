# 1 Timothy 03 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

[3:16](../03/16.md) was probably a song, poem, or creed the early church used to express what it understood to be the meaning of who Jesus was and what he did.

### Overseers and deacons
The church has used different titles for church leaders. Some titles include elder, pastor, and bishop. The word “overseer” reflects the Greek term in verses 1-2, which means literally an “over-seer.” The word “bishop” is derived directly from the letters of this Greek term. Paul writes about another kind of church leader, a “deacon,” in verses 8 and 12.

### Character qualities
This chapter lists several qualities that an overseer or deacon in the church must have. (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])
