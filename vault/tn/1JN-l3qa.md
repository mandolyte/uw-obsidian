# 1 John 04 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. It is false teaching to deny that Jesus became human (4:1–6)
2. Genuine believers love one another as God has loved them (4:7–21)

## Special concepts in this chapter

### “Spirit” and “spirit”

John uses the word “spirit” in different ways in this chapter.
Sometimes the word “spirit” refers to a supernatural being.
Sometimes the word “spirit” refers to the character of something. The expressions “the spirit of the antichrist,” “the spirit of truth,” and “the spirit of error” refer to what is typical of them.
When the word is written with a capital letter, as in the expressions “the Spirit of God” and “his Spirit,” it refers to the Holy Spirit.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Loving God

If people love God, they should show it in the way they live and the way they treat other people. Doing this may assure us that God has saved us and that we belong to him. But loving others does not save us. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. John says in 4:7 that “everyone who loves is begotten from God and knows God.” As the notes explain, this means that God is the spiritual father of everyone who loves, and everyone who loves is in a close relationship with God. But that love is a sign that they belong to God because of what Jesus did for them on the cross, as John says in 4:10. They were saved by what Jesus did, not because they themselves loved others.

## Important textual issues in this chapter

In [4:3](../04/03.md), the most accurate ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus.” That is the reading that ULT follows. Some other ancient manuscripts say “acknowledge Jesus Christ having come in the flesh.” (Some of these manuscripts say “Jesus” or “the Lord Jesus” instead of “Jesus Christ.”) If a translation of the Bible already exists in your region, consider using whichever reading is found in that version. If a translation does not already exist, we recommend that you follow the reading in the ULT text. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
