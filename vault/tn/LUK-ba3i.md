## Special concepts in this chapter

### Miracles

In this chapter, Jesus makes a storm stop by speaking to it, he makes a dead girl alive by speaking to her, and he makes evil spirits leave a man by speaking to them. (See: [[../bible/kt/miracle]])

## Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Parables

Parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people who wanted to believe in him could easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. But people who did not want to believe in him would not be able to understand the message (Luke 8:4-15).

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Brothers and sisters


Most people use the terms “brother” and “sister" for those who have the same parents 
as they do. They think of them as some of the most important people in their lives. Some people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter, Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[../bible/kt/brother]])

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### “having spent all her living on doctors”

In [8:43](../08/43.md), some ancient manuscripts of the Bible have the phrase “having spent all her living on doctors,” but other manuscripts do not. ULT includes the phrase in its text, but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to whether it was an original part of the book of Luke. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to include the phrase if it does, but leave it out if it does not include it. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
