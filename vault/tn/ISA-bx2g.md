# Isaiah 33 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

This chapter continues the series of “woes.” It speaks against ungodly or evil people in general. (See: [[../bible/kt/woe]] and [[../bible/kt/godly]] and [[../bible/kt/evil]])
