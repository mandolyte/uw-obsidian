# Exodus 04 General Notes

## Potential Translation Issues

### Quotations

* There is a difficult transition between [4:4](../04/04.md) and [4:5](../04/05.md) because the quotation stops in the middle to inject a bit of narrative. When it resumes in [4:5](../04/05.md), the sentence seems incomplete (even if merged directly with the quotation fragment in [4:4](../04/04.md)). (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])* Yahweh’s instructions to Moses are complex and there are up to four levels of quotations in this chapter. Translators will need to decide if some of these need to become indirect quotations (if that is possible in their language) and take great care to use the proper quotation markings in the proper location.

### Order of events

* The order of events is not always clear. In [4:14](../04/14.md) Yahweh tells Moses that Aaron is coming to meet him, but Yahweh telling Aaron to go meet Moses in the wilderness is not recorded until [4:27](../04/27.md).
* The timing of the events in [4:18](../18/.md)\-[4:27](../04/23.md), especially verse 18-19 and 27, in relation to the rest of the events of the chapter is unclear.

### Thus says Yahweh

The first of over 400 occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh occurs in [4:22](../04/22.md). It occurs ten times in the book of Exodus; nine of these are between chapters 4–11. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your leader that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the leader, that would be a good phrase to consider.

### Yahweh’s attempt to kill someone

The encounter recorded from [4:24](../04/24.md) to [4:26](../04/26.md) is one of the strangest and most difficult passages in the entire book. Difficulties include:

* To whom do the pronouns refer? Masculine pronouns are used throughout the section, but there are two possible antecedents, Moses (who is not named in the narrative) and Zipporah’s son (who was presumably also Moses’ son, but this is how he is referred to in this text. For why, see below on why Yahweh did this). Most commentators believe the pronouns refer to Moses.
* Circumcision is described in fairly graphic detail. Different cultures will need to approach this differently. Some may have terms for circumcision, while others may be comfortable translating mostly literally, and others will need to use euphemisms or other strategies to translate. (See: [[../bible/kt/circumcise]])* The meaning of the phrase **a bridegroom of blood** (ULT) is unknown.
* Why did Yahweh attack Moses? Many commentators conclude that Moses had neglected to circumcise one of his sons because it displeased Zipporah, and Yahweh was holding Moses responsible before he returned to lead the Israelites (who should have been circumcised). When Zipporah repented by circumcising the son herself and touching the foreskin to Moses’ feet, Yahweh relents. These conclusions should help inform translation but should not be made explicit in the text.

## Study concepts in this chapter

### Moses does not understand

Although Moses believes in Yahweh, he does not trust in him. This is because Moses lacks understanding. Moses tries to believe the things he is asked to do are done by his own power. Yahweh is trying to get Moses to trust that these things are Yahweh’s doing. (See: [[../bible/kt/believe]] and [[../bible/kt/trust]])

### Children of God

This chapter introduces the concept that Israel, the people group, is the chosen people of God and God’s firstborn son. (See: [[../bible/kt/elect]] and [[../bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[../bible/other/firstborn]])

### Yahweh hardened Pharaoh’s heart

Scholars are divided over how to understand this statement. There is debate over whether Pharaoh plays an active or passive role in the hardening of his own heart. Translators should simply follow the text. In Exodus 4-14 there are ten statements that Yahweh hardens Pharaoh’s heart, and ten statements that Pharaoh hardens his own heart.
