### Solomonâ€™s dream
God appeared again to Solomon in a dream and said the temple was acceptable and he honored it with his presence. He would remain as long as Israel obeyed him. If they worshiped other gods and idols he would let their enemies destroy the temple. (See: [[../bible/kt/temple]] and [[../bible/kt/falsegod]])
