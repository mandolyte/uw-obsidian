## Special concepts in this chapter

### Harvest

Harvest refers to the time when people gather in the food they have planted so they can eat some of it right away and store the rest for future use. Jesus uses this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about him so that those people can become part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[../bible/kt/faith]])

### Neighbor

The Jews helped their Jewish neighbors who needed help, and they expected their Jewish neighbors to help them. Jesus wanted them to understand that people who were not Jews were also their neighbors, so he told them a story about this (10:29-37). (See: [[figs-parables]])

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### “72”

In 10:1 and 10:17, some ancient manuscripts of the Bible read “72,” but others read “70.” ULT reads “72,” but it mentions in a footnote that scholars are divided as to which number was originally in the book of Luke.

### “Jesus”

In 10:39, many of the best ancient manuscripts read “Jesus,” but some read “the Lord.” ULT reads “Jesus.”

In both of these cases, if a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the example of ULT. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
