# Isaiah 22 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in this chapter.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Repentance
On this day of judgment, Judah should be repenting of their sin. Instead, they are celebrating it. Although Judah avoids Yahweh’s punishment through the Assyrians, their punishment will still come. (See: [[../bible/kt/judge]] and [[../bible/kt/repent]] and [[../bible/kt/sin]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### “Valley of Visions”
This is a metaphor used in this prophecy against the nation of Judah. (See: [[figs-metaphor]] and [[../bible/kt/prophet]])
