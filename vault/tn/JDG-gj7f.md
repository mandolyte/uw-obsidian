### The sin of Benjamin
People from a village of the tribe of Benjamin raped a visitor’s wife to death. This was very evil, especially in the ancient Near East. The people of Israel considered mistreatment of a guest one of the worst crimes. (See: [[figs-explicit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
