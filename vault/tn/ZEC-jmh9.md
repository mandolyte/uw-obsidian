# Zechariah 10 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

This chapter is written mainly in prose but still uses figurative language as the writer shares a message of redemption and hope for the exiles. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]])

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in 10:1-2.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Redemption
This book, and especially this chapter, uses the concepts of redemption and remnant to share the relationship that the people of Judah have with their God. So many of the people of Israel perished as their kingdom went into exile. Now they are returning to the land, but the land is no longer theirs. They are living under foreign rule. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/redeem]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/remnant]])
