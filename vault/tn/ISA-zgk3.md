# General Information:

Isaiah continues to describe the time when God will save the people of Israel. Although these events will happen in the future ([Isaiah 9:1](./01.md)), Isaiah describes them as if they have already happened. This emphasizes that they certainly will happen. (See: [[figs-pastforfuture]])
