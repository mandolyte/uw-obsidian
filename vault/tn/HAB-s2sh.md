# General Information:

Habakkuk begins to describe his vision of Yahweh coming to judge his enemies and to save his people. The vision continues through [Habakkuk 3:15](../03/15.md). It is full of metaphorical language and uses different kinds of parallelism. (See: [[figs-metaphor]] and [[figs-parallelism]])
