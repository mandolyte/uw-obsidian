# Exodus 08 General Notes
## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

- the exact insects in plagues 3-4 are not certain, translation teams will need to decide what insects they can use for each
- Pharaoh makes his own heart heavy, that is, he determines to be proud and resist Yahweh twice in this chapter
- the Israelites’ sacrifices are spoken of as an abomination to the Egyptians but it is not specified how or why that is


### Lifting up the hand and staff: 
In the next few chapters God will instruct Moses and/or Aaron to raise his hand and/or staff. The narrative will then record that whoever will raise his hand and/or staff. The instruction and the action do not always match exactly. God may say raise your hand and the narrative may say Moses raised his staff. These are not conflicting reports. Translators should understand that the hand and the staff are always understood together. They are one unit and they can both be mentioned or they can be mentioned separately. In each case, Moses or Aaron raises his hand with the staff in it. This fact is merely expressed differently.


## Special concepts in this chapter

### Pharaoh’s hard heart
Pharaoh’s heart is often described as hard in this chapter. This means that his heart was not open or willing to understand Yahweh’s instructions. When his heart was hardened, it became less and less receptive to Yahweh.

### Let my people go

This is a very important statement. Moses does not ask Pharaoh for permission to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.
