# Luke 06 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. Jesus teaches about the Sabbath (6:1–11)
2. Jesus chooses twelve apostles (6:12–16)
3. Jesus teaches about being his disciple (6:17–49)

The long teaching in Luke 6:20-49 begins with blessings and woes that are similar to the beginning of the long teaching in Matthew 5-7. That part of Matthew has traditionally been called the “Sermon on the Mount.” The teaching here in Luke has many other similarities with the one in Matthew’s gospel.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### “Eating the grain”

When the disciples plucked and ate the grain in a field they were walking through on the Sabbath (Luke 6:1), the Pharisees said that they were breaking the law of Moses. The Pharisees said this because they thought that the disciples were doing work by picking the grain, and so they were disobeying God’s command to rest and not work on the Sabbath. The Pharisees did not think the disciples were stealing. That is because the law of Moses told farmers to allow travelers to pluck and eat small amounts of grain from plants in fields that they traveled through or near.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### The twelve disciples

The following are the lists of the twelve disciples:

In Matthew:

Simon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.

In Mark:

Simon (Peter), Andrew, James the son of Zebedee and John the son of Zebedee (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder), Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.

In Luke:

Simon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon (who was called the Zealot), Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot.

The man whom Luke calls Judas the son of James is probably the same man whom Matthew and Mark call Thaddaeus. However, you do not need to explain that in your translation or give both names. You can translate Luke’s list as he wrote it, and allow Bible teachers to explain the reason for the difference.
