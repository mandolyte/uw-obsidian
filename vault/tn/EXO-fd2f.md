## Special concepts in this chapter

### Unleavened bread
The concept of unleavened bread is introduced in this chapter. Its significance stems from its connection to the events in this chapter. (See: [[../bible/kt/unleavenedbread]])

### Ethnic segregation
The Hebrew people were to be separate from the rest of the world. Because of this, they separated themselves from other people groups. At this time, these foreigners were looked upon as unholy. (See: [[../bible/kt/holy]])


## Potential translation issues:

### Passover


### Pronoun usage
In the long quotation (verses 3-20) that Yahweh tells Moses and Aaron to convey to the Israelites he speaks of them in the third person (“they must”) in [verses 3](../12/03.md)–4 and [verses 7](../12/07.md)–8 and to them in the second person (“you must”) for all the rest of the instruction. Some languages may need to keep the pronoun person consistent throughout the quotation.


### You plural
In this chapter, almost every occurrence of “you” or “your” is plural. Each one refers to all the Israelites. Those that are not will be marked. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form throughout unless otherwise noted. (See: [[figs-youdual]])
