# Exodus 06 General Notes

## Possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Repetition of events:

Most of the content of this chapter is very similar to the events and dialogue in chapters 3-4. For consistency, translators should consult the decisions they made there while keeping in mind that this narrative is not exactly the same. Also, verses 10-12 and verses 28-30 are very similar to each other. These events are probably a recommissioning of Moses. After his first encounter with Pharaoh went very poorly and the Israelites seem to reject God, reminds Moses of God’s promises and power.

### Referring to God

A name for God (**Yahweh**) and a title for God (**El Shaddai**) are mentioned in this chapter ([6:2](../06/02.md)\-[6:3](../06/03.md)). The precise meaning of El Shaddai is not known, but most scholars think it means something like “almighty.” Translators who have worked on Genesis may find confusing the statement that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did not know Yahweh as the name of God.

### Other possible translation difficulties:

With little explanation, a large portion of the chapter is devoted to the genealogy of Moses and Aaron. Some of the people in the genealogy lived much longer than is normal for humans today. If translators are not familiar with the lengths of people’s lives in the early days of the world (as recorded in Genesis, especially chapter 5), this may cause confusion.

## Study concepts in this chapter

### Promised Land

According to the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham, Egypt is not the home of the Hebrew people. Their home is the Promised Land in Canaan. The people are to return home to their land. (See: [[../bible/kt/covenant]] and [[../bible/kt/promisedland]])

### “Let my people go”

This is a very important statement. Moses is not asking Pharaoh to “let go” of the Hebrew people. Instead, he is demanding that Pharaoh free the Hebrew people.

### God and his people

In verse 7, note mention of a very important biblical theme of God being “your God” and the special relationship that his people have with him.
