## Special concepts in this chapter

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter
### Context
Micah does not frequently explain the historical context of his prophecies. This may result in the translator failing to understand implicit information. Additional research may be needed regarding the time period of Micahâ€™s ministry. Therefore, translators have a good understanding of the history of the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]] and [[figs-explicit]])
