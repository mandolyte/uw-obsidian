# Isaiah 04 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### More women than men
This chapter describes a time when there will be many more women than men in Judah. This is because so many of Judahâ€™s fighting men will have died before the exile. Those who come through this difficult time will be a holy remnant. (See: [[figs-explicit]] and [[../bible/kt/holy]] and [[../bible/kt/remnant]])
