# Jeremiah 14 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 14:1-10, 17-22.

## Special concepts in this chapter

### False prophets

The false prophets promised there would not be any war or drought. They gave people a false sense of hope, when they needed to repent. Because of this, Yahweh sent a drought and said that the false prophets would die of drought and war. This showed that these were not true prophets of Yahweh. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]], [[../bible/kt/promise]] and [[../bible/kt/hope]] and [[../bible/kt/repent]])
