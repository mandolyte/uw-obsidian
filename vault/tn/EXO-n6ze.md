# Exodus 03 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

This chapter records one of the most important events in the history of the Israelite people: the revelation of the name Yahweh at the burning bush. (See: [[../bible/kt/reveal]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

### God’s holiness

God is so holy that people could not look upon him without dying. This is why Moses covered his eyes. It is also why he took off his shoes. (See: [[../bible/kt/holy]] and [[figs-explicit]])

### Yahweh

The name Yahweh is sacred in the Hebrew religion. It is the personal name of God, which he revealed to Moses. It is by this name that he is known. Yahweh means “I am.” Some translations use all capitals to set this apart, “I AM.” Great care must be taken in translating the phrase “I am that I am.” (See: [[../bible/kt/yahweh]])

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### Participants

“The angel of Yahweh,” “Yahweh,” and “God” all appear to be speaking to Moses and interacting with him from the burning bush. Furthermore, God says that his name is “I AM.” (See note above on Yahweh and I AM.) Yahweh and God are the same while there is speculation about who the angel of Yahweh is.
