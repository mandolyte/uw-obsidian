# General Information:

Verses 13 and 14 give background information about this part of the story. “Paul and his friends” were Barnabas and John Mark (also called John). From this point on, Saul is called Paul in Acts. Paul’s name is listed first which indicates that he had become the leader of the group. It is important to keep this order in the translation. (See: [[writing-background]])
