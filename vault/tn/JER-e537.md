# Jeremiah 51 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 51:1-64.

The prophesied destruction of Babylon continues in this chapter. (See: [[../bible/kt/prophet]])

## Special concepts in this chapter
### Babylon destroyed

Babylon will be conquered and the Jews will return to their homeland. At this time, Babylon controlled almost the entire Near East. The fulfillment of this prophecy would have been unthinkable. (See: [[../bible/kt/fulfill]])

### Covenant with Abraham
Babylon is destroyed because it drove the people of Judah from their homeland. This is in line with the promises of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham to curse those who curse Abraham’s descendants. (See: [[../bible/kt/promise]] and [[../bible/kt/covenant]] and [[../bible/kt/curse]])
