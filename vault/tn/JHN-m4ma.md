# General Information:

Jesus is speaking to a crowd near the treasury in the temple after either the events of [John 7:1-52](../07/01.md) or the events of [John 7:53-8:11](../07/53.md). The author neither gives background to this event nor marks the beginning of a new event. (See: [[writing-background]] and [[writing-newevent]])
