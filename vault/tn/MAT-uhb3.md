# General Information:

This image of walking through a wide gate to destruction or a narrow gate to life represents how people live and the results of how they live. When you translate, use appropriate words for “wide” and “broad” that are as different as possible from “narrow” in order to emphasize the differences between the two sets of gates and ways.
