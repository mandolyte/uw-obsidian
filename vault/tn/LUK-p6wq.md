# Luke 23 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. Jesus stands trial before Pilate and Herod (23:1–25)
2. The Roman soldiers crucify Jesus (23:26–49)
3. Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus and women prepare spices (23:50–56)

## Special concepts in this chapter

### “The curtain of the temple was split in two”

The curtain in the temple was an important symbol that showed that people needed to have someone speak to God for them. They could not speak to God directly because all people are sinful and God hates sin. God split the curtain to show that Jesus’ people can now speak to God directly because Jesus has paid for their sins.

### The tomb

The tomb in which Jesus was buried (Luke 23:53) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise”

There are two translation issues related to the statement, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise” in [23:42](../23/42.md).

(1) When Jesus said this to the criminal who was crucified with him, it is possible that he was using the term **paradise** figuratively to mean “heaven,” describing it by association with the way that it is a place of comfort and consolation. Some groups of believers would understand it that way. However, other groups of believers would say that people who express their faith in Jesus, as this criminal did, still need to wait until the final resurrection before they go to heaven, and so **paradise** refers to a place where such people go when they die and await the final resurrection. Be sensitive to this difference in your translation. You may decide it is best simply to use the term **paradise** and leave the meaning open. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

(2) Some groups that may be active in your area, such as the Jehovah’s Witnesses, do not honor Jesus as the Son of God, and so they do not believe that he would have been able to promise the criminal entrance into paradise with himself that day, when they both would die. And so they translate or punctuate this so that the word **today** describes when Jesus is making the statement, rather than when the criminal will be in paradise. However, if that were actually the case, the Greek wording and word order would be different. The expression that introduces the statement would be, “Truly, today, I say to you,” or, “Truly I say to you today that.” The actual expression, “Truly I say to you,” occurs ten times in the book of Luke, and it always stands by itself as an introduction to a statement that follows. So **today** belongs with the statement, not with the introduction to the statement. Your language may have a way of making this clear, for example, by saying, “Truly I say to you, you will be with me in paradise today.”

## Important textual issues in this chapter

### “And he was obligated to release one to them at every feast” [23:17](../23/17.md)

This verse is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible. Most scholars consider it to be a later addition for explanation. Many current versions of the Bible do not include it. Some versions put it into square brackets. We recommend that you do not translate this verse. However, if there are older versions of the Bible in your region that include this verse, you may include it.

### “Jesus said, ‘Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.’” [23:34](../23/34.md)

This sentence is not in the earliest and most accurate manuscripts of the Bible, and so it is likely not an original part of the gospel of Luke. However, many scholars consider it an authentic saying of Jesus that was copied into the book at an early stage. ULT and UST include this sentence in this verse, but some other versions do not.

If you decide to include either [23:17](../23/17.md) or the additional sentence [23:34](../23/34.md) in your translation, you should enclose the material in square brackets to indicate that it is probably not original to Luke’s Gospel. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
