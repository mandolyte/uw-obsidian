# General Information:

The fourth part of the book begins here. The young woman uses euphemisms to describe her dream so that it can be interpreted in two different ways: (1) the woman describes a dream about a night when the man came to visit her at her house; and (2) the woman describes a dream about starting to sleep with the man.
