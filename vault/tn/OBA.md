## xm1w
### חֲז֖וֹן עֹֽבַדְיָ֑ה (1)
This is the title of the book. Here **vision** is used in the general sense of a message from Yahweh, rather than to indicate how Obadiah received that message. **Vision** here is a metaphor for the way that God gives knowledge to people. Alternate translation: “The message that God gave to Obadiah” or “The prophecy of Obadiah” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## jdr1
### עֹֽבַדְיָ֑ה (1)
Some English translations call the prophet Abdias, but Obadiah is the form of his name most commonly used in English. Use the form of the name that is used in your source language or a form that is similar that sounds like a name in your language. (See: [[translate-names]])

## sv9x
### כֹּֽה־אָמַר֩ אֲדֹנָ֨⁠י יְהוִ֜ה (1)
This introduces the rest of the book as a message from God. Use a form here that is natural in your language for introducing what someone says. (See: [[writing-quotations]])

### יְהוִ֜ה (1)
This is the name of God that he revealed to his people in the Old Testament. (See: [[translate-names]])

## jdr3
### לֶ⁠אֱד֗וֹם (1)
People are being described here by the name of something closely associated with them, **Edom**, the land that they live in. If this is not clear in your language, you can say clearly that this message is about the people. Alternate translation: “concerning the people of Edom.” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## jdr5
### שָׁמַ֜עְנוּ (1)
Obadiah is speaking as one person among the many in the nations around Edom who have heard Yahweh’s message, including the people of Israel. If your language has an inclusive form for **We**, use that here. (See: [[figs-exclusive]])

## c8w8
### שָׁמַ֜עְנוּ (1)
Obadiah is speaking to the people of Judah about the people of Edom. So **We** here is inclusive; others in Judah have also heard or are now hearing the message calling the nations to war against Edom. (See: [[figs-exclusive]])

## jdr7
### וְ⁠צִיר֙ & שֻׁלָּ֔ח (1)
If it is more natural in your language, you can use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, have sent a messenger” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## r27r
### וְ⁠צִיר֙ & שֻׁלָּ֔ח (1)
You could specify who sent the messenger. Alternate translation: “and Yahweh has sent a messenger” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## jdr9
### ק֛וּמוּ וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ לַ⁠מִּלְחָמָֽה (1)
The end of the verse is not spoken by Obadiah himself. Rather, these are the words of Yahweh’s messenger. They can be presented as a quotation with an introductory formula such as “saying,” or as indirect quotation as in UST. (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## pez6
### ק֛וּמוּ (1)
This phrase is used to tell people to get ready, in this case to attack Edom. Alternate translation: “Get ready” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## c9e2
### וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ (1)
Here, **her** refers to the land of Edom, which, again, stands for the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “Let us rise up against the people of Edom” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## jd1r
### לַ⁠מִּלְחָמָֽה (1)
If it is clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract noun **battle** with a verb. Alternate translation: “to attack her” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 1:2
## cc3h
### הִנֵּ֥ה קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ (1)
The addressee changes here. This is no longer Yahweh speaking to Judah or the messenger speaking to the other nations. Now Yahweh is speaking directly to the people of Edom. If it would be clearer in your language, you could add a quote introduction here, as in the UST. (See: [[writing-quotations]])

## npn6
### הִנֵּ֥ה (1)
This alerts the people of Edom to pay special attention to what follows. Use a natural way of getting someone’s attention in your language. Alternate translation: “Look” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you”

## l6dc
### קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם בָּז֥וּי אַתָּ֖ה מְאֹֽד (1)
These two phrases mean similar things and are used together to emphasize that Edom will lose its important status. If it would be more natural in your language, you could combine them as in the UST. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## ec8m
### קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם (1)
Something insignificant is spoken of figuratively as if it were small in size and could easily be overlooked. Alternate translation: “insignificant among the nations” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## ch1u
### בָּז֥וּי אַתָּ֖ה מְאֹֽד (1)
You could state this in the active form. Alternate translation: “the people of other nations will hate you” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 1:3
## kjbt
### זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ הִשִּׁיאֶ֔⁠ךָ (1)
Here, **pride** is spoken of figuratively as though it were a person who could deceive someone. If this is not clear, you could say this with plain language.
Alternate translation: “Because you are so proud, you have deceived yourselves” (See: [[figs-personification]])

## hzdk
### זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ הִשִּׁיאֶ֔⁠ךָ (1)
Here, **you** is singular, since it refers to the people of Edom as a single nation, but if this is confusing in your language, you can use a plural form of “you” here and throughout this book. (See: [[figs-youcrowd]])

## kcc3
### זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ (1)
If it is clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract noun **pride** with the adjective “proud.” Alternate translation: “Your proud attitude” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## qpw7
### זְד֤וֹן לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙ (1)
Here, **heart** is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings.
Alternate translation: “Your proud attitude” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## k9sw
### שֹׁכְנִ֥י בְ⁠חַגְוֵי־סֶּ֖לַע (1)
Here, the pronoun switches from **you** to **he** even though Yahweh is still talking to the people of Edom. If this is confusing in your language, you can continue to use **you**, since this is part of Yahweh’s continuing message to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “you who live in the clefts of the rock” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## q6sz
### בְ⁠חַגְוֵי־סֶּ֖לַע (1)
This means a place that is protected because it is surrounded by rocks.

## r5zj
### אֹמֵ֣ר בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
This says **he** and **his,** as if Yahweh were talking aloud about Edom rather than to Edom, but it can be translated with **you** as part of Yahweh’s continuing words to the people. Alternate translation: “you who say in your heart” or “you who say to yourselves” (See: [[figs-123person]])

## jd3r
### אֹמֵ֣ר בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
Here, the heart is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings. Alternate translation: “he who says to himself” or “you who think” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## i2hx
### מִ֥י יוֹרִדֵ֖⁠נִי אָֽרֶץ (1)
This rhetorical question expresses how proud the Edomites were and how safe they felt. Alternate translation: “no one can bring me down to the ground” or “I am safe from all attackers” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

# 1:4
## xn9f
### אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ (1)
These two expressions have similar meanings. This is a way of showing that something is important by saying it more than once but in slightly different ways. If this is not clear in your language, use another way of showing that this is important. Alternate translation: “Even if you had wings and could live high up among the eagles, or even up among the stars” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## jd5r
### אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ (1)
The people of Edom think that they are safe because they live up high in the mountains. Yahweh is saying that even if they lived much higher than it is actually possible for humans to live, they would still not be safe. Alternate translation: “and I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly, and if you could make your homes among the stars” (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## jd7r
### שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ (1)
If your language does not use passive verb forms, you could use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “if you could make your homes” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## bbu3
### מִ⁠שָּׁ֥ם אוֹרִֽידְ⁠ךָ֖ (1)
Here, **bring you down** means “humble you” or “defeat you.” This is a spatial metaphor. Yahweh’s response to the Edomites is that there is nowhere they would be safe from his judgment and punishment. Alternate translation: “you would still not be safe there from the attackers that I am sending” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## ce6e
### נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה (1)
This phrase reminds the reader that this message, including the entire book, came directly from Yahweh. Use a form of quotation that would make this clear in your language. (See: [[writing-quotations]])

## fyco
### נְאֻם־יְהוָֽה (1)
If it would be more natural in your language, instead of the abstract noun **declaration**, you could use a verb here. Alternate translation: “Yahweh declares this to you.” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 1:5
## w86v
### אִם־גַּנָּבִ֤ים בָּאֽוּ־לְ⁠ךָ֙ אִם־שׁ֣וֹדְדֵי לַ֔יְלָה (1)
These two phrases mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the one idea that they are expressing. If this is not clear in your language, use another way of showing that this is important or you could combine them, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## b93f
### אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה (1)
You could use the active form of the verb, and you could specify who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “how the attackers will destroy you” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## jd9r
### אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה (1)
Yahweh adds this phrase in the middle of another sentence to express that the punishment of Edom is shocking. Unlike thieves and grape-harvesters, those who attack Edom will leave nothing behind. If it would be clearer in your language, you could move the phrase to the end of the verse and make it its own sentence. Alternate translation: “But attackers will destroy you completely” (See: [[figs-exclamations]])

## q1pg
### הֲ⁠ל֥וֹא יִגְנְב֖וּ דַּיָּ֑⁠ם (1)
This is a rhetorical question. The question form is used to make a point strongly. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, you can use a statement here. Alternate translation: “they would only steal what they wanted” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## k12c
### אִם־בֹּֽצְרִים֙ בָּ֣אוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ הֲ⁠ל֖וֹא יַשְׁאִ֥ירוּ עֹלֵלֽוֹת (1)
This is a rhetorical question. The question form is used to make a point strongly. If you do not use rhetorical questions in this way in your language, you can use a statement here. Alternate translation: “they would certainly leave some grapes behind” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

# 1:6
## gpm5
### אֵ֚יךְ (1)
Here, **How** introduces an exclamation to express amazement that the pillaging of Edom is so extreme. Use a natural way in your language to express this. Alternate translation: “In an extreme way” or “Completely” (See: [[figs-exclamations]])

## zsf7
### אֵ֚יךְ נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ עֵשָׂ֔ו (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the active form of this verb, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “How the attackers will ransack the country of Edom” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## m9p3
### עֵשָׂ֔ו (1)
Here, the name **Esau** refers to the people of Edom. They were the descendants of Esau, who was also known as Edom. All the people of Edom are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. If this is confusing in your language, you can refer to the people instead, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-personification]])

## lf9t
### נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ (1)
Here, **ransacked** means that the enemies have searched through the people’s things, taken everything valuable, and left everything else in a mess or damaged.

## w96y
### נִבְע֖וּ מַצְפֻּנָֽי⁠ו (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the active form of this verb, and you could say who is doing the action. Alternate translation: “They will search out all of his hidden treasures” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

# 1:7
## yobe
### עַֽד־הַ⁠גְּב֣וּל שִׁלְּח֗וּ⁠ךָ כֹּ֚ל אַנְשֵׁ֣י בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ (1)
If it does not make sense in your language to say that someone would be attacked by someone with whom they have a **covenant**, that is, an ally, then you can add in the missing step of their betrayal, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## n3t6
### בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ (1)
Yahweh is still addressing the people of Edom here, so the word **your** refers to them. (See: [[figs-youcrowd]])

## cr88
### עַֽד־הַ⁠גְּב֣וּל שִׁלְּח֗וּ⁠ךָ (1)
There are two possibilities for what **the border** could refer to. (1) It could refer to the border of the country of Edom. Alternate translation: “will force you out of your country” or (2) it could refer to the border of a formerly friendly country. Alternate translation: “will reject you from taking refuge in their country”

## a612
### כֹּ֚ל אַנְשֵׁ֣י בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ & אַנְשֵׁ֣י שְׁלֹמֶ֑⁠ךָ לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗ (1)
All three phrases refer to Edom’s allies. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once in similar ways. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## jd15
### לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗ יָשִׂ֤ימוּ מָזוֹר֙ תַּחְתֶּ֔י⁠ךָ (1)
Hebrew says simply **your bread**. In this poetic style, hearers and readers are expected to understand the meaning and supply the missing words **The men of** from the previous two lines. (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])

## rc1i
### אֵ֥ין תְּבוּנָ֖ה בּֽ⁠וֹ (1)
There are four possibilities for the meaning of this phrase. (1) Yahweh could be saying this as an aside in order to express his evaluation of the people of Edom. If this would be confusing in your language, you can continue the address to Edom in the second person, as in the UST. (2) the former allies could be saying this about Edom. Alternate translation: “Then they will say to you, ‘you are not as clever as you thought you were’” (3) It could be referring to the trap just mentioned. Alternate translation: “and there is no perception of it” (4) It could be referring to the shocking situation of Edom being betrayed by its allies. Alternate translation: “There is no understanding of this” (See: [[figs-aside]])

## jd17
### אֵ֥ין תְּבוּנָ֖ה בּֽ⁠וֹ (1)
You could translate the abstract noun “understanding” with a verb. Alternate translation: “He does not understand anything” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## jd19
### בּֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Here, **him** probably refers to Edom, which represents the people who live there. Alternate translation: “in the people of Edom” (See: [[figs-personification]])

# 1:8
## i4rg
### הֲ⁠ל֛וֹא בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא & וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֤י חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם (1)
This is a rhetorical question. Yahweh uses the question form here to emphasize that he will certainly do this. Alternate translation: “On that day … I will certainly destroy the wise men from Edom” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## jd21
### וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֤י חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם (1)
The original audience would have known that Edom was famous for its wisdom. So this means that even their famous wisdom cannot save them from Yahweh’s destruction. If it would be clearer, you could indicate this information as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## i6ry
### וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו (1)
This is the second part of the rhetorical question. You could also start a new sentence here. Yahweh continues the question form here to emphasize that he will certainly do this. Alternate translation: “and I will certainly destroy their understanding” or “On that day I will certainly remove understanding from the mountain of Esau” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## mupa
### וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו (1)
In this poetic style, the reader is expected to use the words **will I not on that day destroy** from the first rhetorical question in order to understand this second one. If that is not clear in your language, you can repeat those words here. Alternate translation: “and will I not on that day destroy understanding from the mountain of Esau?” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## g6se
### חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו (1)
In this poetic style, the same meaning is expressed twice but in different words in order to emphasize what is being said. Here, **wise men** and **understanding** both refer to people who are wise, and **Edom** and **the mountain of Esau** are both ways of referring to the country of Edom. If this is confusing in your language, you could say this only once, or emphasize the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “all people who are wise from the country of Edom” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## jd23
### וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה (1)
You could translate this abstract noun with a verbal phrase. Alternate translation: “and people who know what to do” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## z8tf
### מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו (1)
Yahweh is referring to the whole territory of Edom by using the name of one prominent part of it. The **mountain of Esau** may be the one now called Mount Bozrah. Alternate translation: “from the land of Edom” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## gn3t
### עֵשָֽׂו (1)
This is the name of the man who was the ancestor of the people of Edom. See how you translated this in [verse 6](../01/06.md). (See: [[translate-names]])

# 1:9
## jd25
### וְ⁠חַתּ֥וּ גִבּוֹרֶ֖י⁠ךָ תֵּימָ֑ן (1)
Yahweh continues speaking to the people of Edom, but now he addresses them as **Teman**, which was the name of the region around their capital city. This part of Edom is now being used to represent the whole people. Alternate translation: “People of Edom, your strong soldiers will become terrified” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## qvg3
### תֵּימָ֑ן (1)
Teman is the name of a region in the land of Edom. Yahweh is referring to the whole territory of Edom by the name of one part of it. Alternate translation: “O people of Edom” (See: [[translate-names]])

## ljv4
### לְמַ֧עַן (1)
There is a cause-and-effect relationship here. Yahweh says in v. 8 that he will destroy the wise men in Edom, and here in v. 9 that the mighty men of Edom will be “dismayed” (that is, they will give up trying to fight). The people of Edom trusted in these two groups to protect them. So as a result of Yahweh destroying these two groups, no others in Edom will escape the invading armies, either. Alternate translation: “with the result that” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

## jd27
### יִכָּֽרֶת־אִ֛ישׁ (1)
Here, **cut off** is a metaphor for being killed. The Edomites are pictured as part of the mountain where they live, and their death as being cut off from the mountain. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy all of you” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## q6s7
### יִכָּֽרֶת־אִ֛ישׁ (1)

## jd35
### מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָׂ֖ו (1)
As in v. 8, Yahweh is referring to the whole territory by the name of this one part of it. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “from the land of Edom” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## jd37
### מִ⁠קָּֽטֶל (1)
The abstract noun **slaughter** intensifies the idea of being **cut off** or killed. If you would not use an abstract noun like this in your language, you could use an adverb instead. Alternate translation: “violently” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## hsy2
### מִ⁠קָּֽטֶל (1)
Some Bible translations put this phrase with verse 10, rather than with verse 9. If you choose to do that, verse 9 would end, “ … from the mountain of Esau.” Verse 10 would begin, “Because of slaughter, because of violence … ”
(See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

# 1:10
## jd39
### אָחִ֥י⁠ךָ (1)
The term **brother** is being used here to refer to members of a related people group. Use the term that is most natural in your language. Alternate translation: “your relatives who are the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## ui6g
### יַעֲקֹ֖ב (1)
Here the name **Jacob** refers to the people of Judah, who were his descendants. All the people are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. (See: [[figs-personification]])

## jd41
### תְּכַסְּ⁠ךָ֣ בוּשָׁ֑ה (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a verb to translate the abstract noun **shame**. Alternate translation: “you will be dishonored” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## f8g6
### תְּכַסְּ⁠ךָ֣ בוּשָׁ֑ה (1)
To be **covered** with something is an idiom for fully experiencing it. Alternate translation: “you will be completely ashamed” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## a113
### וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy you” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## jd43
### וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ (1)
You can specify who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy you” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## jd45
### וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ (1)
As in [verse 5](../01/05.md), **cut off** is an idiom for being destroyed. See how you translated it there. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy you” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 1:11
## w6hj
### עֲמָֽדְ⁠ךָ֣ מִ⁠נֶּ֔גֶד (1)
This is a metaphor that pictures the people of Edom as a person who was just standing around and not helping a relative. Alternate translation: “you did not help him.” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## s38y
### שְׁב֥וֹת זָרִ֖ים חֵיל֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠נָכְרִ֞ים בָּ֣אוּ שְׁעָרָ֗יו (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that Judah was in a desperate situation. Invading armies were plundering the cities of Judah. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## rtj8
### חֵיל֑⁠וֹ & שְׁעָרָ֗יו (1)
Here, **his** refers to **your brother Jacob** in [verse 10](../01/10.md), meaning the people of Judah. (See: [[figs-personification]])

## jd46
### חֵיל֑⁠וֹ (1)
In this context, the term translated **wealth** could also mean “army.” But since it clearly means “wealth” in [verse 13](../01/13.md), it seems best to translate it as “wealth” here, as well.

## jd47
### שְׁעָרָ֗יו (1)
Here, **gates** stands for “city.” The gates, the part of a city through which people would come and go, are being used to represent the whole city. Alternate translation: “all the cities of Judah” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## i8sr
### וְ⁠עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ יַדּ֣וּ גוֹרָ֔ל (1)
There are two possibilities for the meaning here. (1) This is a figurative way of saying that the **foreigners** had complete control of **Jerusalem**, with Jerusalem pictured as something that everybody wants to have, but it cannot be divided, so they cast lots to see who will get it. Alternate translation: “they even plundered Jerusalem” or (2) The name of the city may be standing for the wealth of the city. Alternate translation: “and they divided the wealth of Jerusalem among themselves” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## s4y1
### גַּם־אַתָּ֖ה כְּ⁠אַחַ֥ד מֵ⁠הֶֽם (1)
The people of Edom did not do exactly the same things as the **strangers** and **foreigners** did, but they were like them because they did not help the people of Judah, who were a related people group. If it would be clearer in your language, you could include this information, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 1:12
## crs1
### וְ⁠אַל & וְ⁠אַל & וְ⁠אַל (1)
Yahweh uses a repetitive series of sentences in verses 12–14 to show how badly the people of Edom have treated the people of Judah. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” This is a list of the charges against the people of Edom. Yahweh goes on to say in verses 15 and 16 that he has found them guilty of all of these charges and that he will punish them. Use a form in your language that someone would use to list things that someone has done wrong. (See: [[figs-litany]])

## e7cd
### וְ⁠אַל־תֵּ֤רֶא (1)
Here, **you should not have looked** implies that the people of Edom were looking on the disaster in Judah with pleasure. To make this clear, you can include this information in the way that you translate. Alternate translation: “you should not have enjoyed looking” or “it was very bad that you enjoyed looking” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## xhd0
### בְ⁠יוֹם־אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ בְּ⁠י֣וֹם נָכְר֔⁠וֹ (1)
The two phrases **on the day of your brother** and **on the day of his misfortune** work together to mean “on the day of your brother’s misfortune.” If having the two phrases is confusing, you can combine them into one phrase, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## crs3
### בְ⁠יוֹם (1)
Here, **on the day** is an idiom that refers to an undefined period of time that could extend from one to very many days. Alternate translation: “at the time of” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## q8md
### אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ (1)
As in [verse 10](../01/10.md), Yahweh describes the people of Judah as a **brother** to the descendants of Esau, because their ancestor, Jacob, was the brother of Esau (Edom). (See: [[figs-personification]])

## f7lt
### לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָ֖ה (1)
Here, the word **sons** does not refer only to men. It refers to all of the descendants of Jacob’s son Judah, and more broadly to all of the Israelites from a number of the different tribes of Israel who had come to live in the kingdom of Judah at this time. Alternate translation: “over the Israelites” (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

## lxg7
### וְ⁠אַל־תַּגְדֵּ֥ל פִּ֖י⁠ךָ (1)

## dwn2
### בְּ⁠י֣וֹם אֵידָ֔⁠ם & בְּ⁠י֣וֹם אֵיד֑⁠וֹ & בְּ⁠י֥וֹם אֵידֽ⁠וֹ (1)
In this poetic style, the same phrase is used at the end of each line to emphasize how terrible the **calamity** was. If this style does not work in your language to communicate an increased emphasis, then you could combine the three occurrences into one and communicate that this was a very bad thing in another way, as in the UST.
(See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## wg54
### אֵידָ֔⁠ם & אֵיד֑⁠וֹ & אֵידֽ⁠וֹ (1)
In the first line of this verse, **their** refers to **my people**. In the second and third lines, God’s people are once again pictured as their ancestor Jacob, and so the singular pronoun **his** is used (see [verse 10](../01/10.md)). If this change is confusing in your language, you can avoid the personification and refer to the people with plural pronouns in all three lines. (See: [[figs-personification]])

## f9q3
### גַם־אַתָּ֛ה (1)
Yahweh is accusing the people of Edom directly, and he adds this exclamation to emphasize this. This exclamation expresses anger, demands their attention, and also may be a warning that they cannot claim to be innocent. If it is confusing to have this in the middle of another sentence, you could make this a separate sentence ending in an exclamation mark, either before or after the current sentence. Alternate translation: “I am talking to you” (See: [[figs-exclamations]])

## crs5
### אַל־תֵּ֧רֶא (1)
In this context, **looked on** is an idiom for “enjoyed looking at.” See how you translated this in [verse 12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: “you should not have gloated” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## jz38
### וְ⁠אַל־תִּשְׁלַ֥חְנָה בְ⁠חֵיל֖⁠וֹ (1)
Here, the word translated as **you** is feminine and plural. In the rest of Obadiah, it is masculine and singular. It may be that God is addressing the women specifically here in case they thought that they were not also guilty. So use a feminine plural form here, or mark this in some other way so that it means “you women.” (See: [[figs-you]])

# 1:14
## ixs7
### הַ⁠פֶּ֔רֶק (1)
A **crossroads** is a place where two roads come together. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## p7i1
### לְ⁠הַכְרִ֖ית (1)
Here, **to cut down** is a metaphor that means “to kill.” It is likely a comparison to the way grain is cut down at harvest time. See how you translated this same metaphor in [verse 9](../01/09.md). (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## qdx9
### וְ⁠אַל־תַּסְגֵּ֥ר שְׂרִידָ֖י⁠ו (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you can make explicit to whom the Edomites delivered the Judean survivors. Alternate translation: “You should not have captured the survivors and delivered them over to the enemy soldiers” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## fa9m
### כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשִׂ֨יתָ֙ יֵעָ֣שֶׂה לָּ֔⁠ךְ גְּמֻלְ⁠ךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ (1)
Bible experts are not certain whether verse 15 goes with verse 14 as the end of the previous section or if it goes with verse 16 as the beginning of the new section. Many Bibles put a section break and a heading before verse 15, such as “God Will Judge the Nations.”

## e5t7
### כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם (1)
Here Yahweh is giving the people of Edom the reason why they should not have done all of the bad things that they did to the Israelites that were listed in verses 11-14, and instead of that, helped them. It is because Yahweh will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. If it would be clearer in your language, you can make this explicit, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## crs7
### יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה (1)
The **day of Yahweh** is an expression that refers to a specific time when God punishes people for their sins. Alternate translation: “the time when I, Yahweh, will judge and punish people for their sins” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## djk9
### גְּמֻלְ⁠ךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ (1)
This is a metaphor that pictures the Edomites as having sent bad things out to others, and now those things are going to come back and hurt them as they land on their heads. Alternate translation: “those same things will soon happen to you” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## cr3s
### בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ (1)
The **head** is being used to represent the whole person. Alternate translation: “to you” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

# 1:16
## nf6s
### כִּ֗י כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙ (1)
As at the beginning of verse 15, here also the connecting word **For** indicates that this is a reason why the people of Edom should have helped the Israelites instead of joining in attacking them. Here also Yahweh describes how he will soon judge all nations for the way that they have treated others. There are two possibilities for how you can make this explicit, if that would be clearer in your language. Choosing between these possibilities depends on how you interpret the referent of the word **you**. The word **you** here is masculine plural, the first and only time it occurs in this form in the book. Throughout the book, the nation of Edom was addressed with the masculine singular form. This is also the last occurrence of the second person in the book. (1) Because of these observations, the use of drinking here and throughout the Bible as a metaphor for suffering punishment, and the location of this suffering on Mount Zion in Jerusalem, it seems that here Obadiah stops addressing the people of Edom and returns to addressing the people of Israel. At the beginning of the book, Obadiah included the people of Israel when he said, “We have heard a report from Yahweh.” Now, near the end of the book, he addresses them again, giving them assurance that the people of Edom will be punished for what they did to the people of Israel. See the UST. (2) This word **you** could refer to the people of Edom. Alternate translation: “You should have helped the people of Israel, because just as you drank” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## cr9s
### כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙ (1)
Throughout the book of Obadiah, the nation of Edom is addressed with a masculine singular form of “you.” (The one feminine plural form in [verse 13](../01/13.md) only addresses the women of Edom). Here, however, **you** is masculine plural. There are two possibilities for who is being addressed here. (1) It refers to the people of Israel. This would explain the shift from singular to plural. Just as Obadiah addressed the people of Israel in the plural in [verse 1](../01/01.md), so he addresses them in the plural now. This interpretation also fits with the metaphor used here and throughout the Bible that pictures suffering and divine punishment as drinking something that makes a person stagger, fall, and die. The people of Israel suffered and died in Jerusalem when the city was destroyed. This also allows the comparison in this verse to fit with the idea in the previous verse that Edom will suffer in the same way that they made Israel to suffer. See the UST. (2) It refers to the people of Edom. In this case, the comparison is between how the people of Edom literally drank wine in celebration of Jerusalem’s destruction with how the nations will metaphorically drink God’s punishment. Either that, or the verb must be forced into a future meaning, and the comparison is between how God will punish the people of Edom in Jerusalem and how God will punish all the nations. Alternate translation: “just as I will punish you” (See: [[writing-pronouns]])

## cr7s
### שְׁתִיתֶם֙ (1)
The image of drinking something is often used in the Bible as a metaphor for suffering or for being punished by God. Alternate translation: “you suffered” or “I punished you” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## ujj9
### עַל־הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֔⁠י (1)
The **mountain of my holiness** refers to Mount Zion and therefore to the city of Jerusalem. So here Jerusalem is being referred to by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on. Alternate translation: “in my holy city, Jerusalem” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## qz7p
### יִשְׁתּ֥וּ כָֽל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֖ם תָּמִ֑יד (1)
Here the metaphor continues, using **drink** to mean “suffer” or “be punished.” Alternate translation: “I will punish all of the nations continually” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## a8v3
### וְ⁠שָׁת֣וּ וְ⁠לָע֔וּ (1)
The words translated **drink** and **swallow** mean very similar things and are used together to intensify the one meaning. If your language does not have two such similar words, you can use one of the words and intensify the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “They will drink all of it down” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## vcve
### וְ⁠שָׁת֣וּ וְ⁠לָע֔וּ (1)
Here the metaphor continues, using **drink** and **swallow** as images for suffering or being punished. Alternate translation: “I will make them suffer a lot” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 1:17

### וּ⁠בְ⁠הַ֥ר צִיּ֛וֹן תִּהְיֶ֥ה פְלֵיטָ֖ה (1)
The abstract noun **escape** refers to the people of Israel who will still be alive in Jerusalem after Yahweh has finished punishing the other nations. As [1:16](../01/16.md) says, those other nations will disappear completely, but the descendants of Jacob will continue as a people. Alternate translation: “But in Jerusalem some people will remain” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## y9pz
### וּ⁠בְ⁠הַ֥ר צִיּ֛וֹן (1)
This is a figure of speech that refers to Jerusalem by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on. Alternate translation: “But in Jerusalem” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## b4sh
### וְ⁠הָ֣יָה קֹ֑דֶשׁ (1)
If your language does not use abstract nouns, you can translate the word **holiness** by using an adjective. Alternate translation: “and it will be a holy place”
(See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## cr13
### בֵּ֣ית יַֽעֲקֹ֔ב (1)
Here, **the house of Jacob** is an idiom that means “the descendants of Jacob” and by extension, all of the people of Israel. Alternate translation: “the people of Israel” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## f4ur
### אֵ֖ת מוֹרָֽשֵׁי⁠הֶם (1)
Here, **possessions** refers to the land that was supposed to be passed down from generation to generation to each of the Israelite families and clans. If using a plural term is confusing, you can translate it with a singular word. Alternate translation: “the land that belongs to each of them”

# 1:18
## rm2e
### וְ⁠הָיָה֩ בֵית־יַעֲקֹ֨ב אֵ֜שׁ וּ⁠בֵ֧ית יוֹסֵ֣ף לֶהָבָ֗ה (1)
These two expressions have similar meanings. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once. Both **house of Jacob** and **house of Joseph** stand for all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: “The Israelites will be like a fire. Yes, they will be like a flame” If saying this twice is confusing, you could combine them into one expression, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## cr15
### בֵית־יַעֲקֹ֨ב (1)
Here, the word **house** means all of the people descended from a particular person. All of the descendants of Jacob are being described figuratively as if they were one household living together. Alternate translation: “the Israelites” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## cr17
### וּ⁠בֵ֧ית יוֹסֵ֣ף (1)
The descendants of Joseph are also being described figuratively as if they were one household. Joseph was the son of Jacob, and his descendants made up a large part of the people of Israel. So Yahweh is using his descendants to represent the whole nation. (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## yt8j
### וּ⁠בֵ֤ית עֵשָׂו֙ & לְ⁠בֵ֣ית עֵשָׂ֔ו (1)
The descendants of Esau (Edom) are also being described figuratively as if they were one household. Alternate translation: “the people of Edom” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## cr19
### אֵ֜שׁ & לֶהָבָ֗ה & לְ⁠קַ֔שׁ (1)
In this metaphor, Yahweh is saying that the Israelites will be like fire and flame, that the people of Edom will be like dry grass, and that the Israelites will do to the people of Edom what fire and flame do to dry grass. In other words, just as fire and flame burn up dry grass until it is all gone, the Israelites who survive will conquer all of Edom. If this metaphor is not clear in your language, you could make it a simile, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## hj8x
### לְ⁠קַ֔שׁ (1)
The word **stubble** means the dry pieces of plants that are left in the ground after their stalks have been cut. Alternate translation: “like dry grass” (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## cr23
### וְ⁠דָלְק֥וּ בָ⁠הֶ֖ם וַ⁠אֲכָל֑וּ⁠ם (1)
**Burn** and **consume** mean almost the same thing. Yahweh uses the words together to intensify the meaning. If you do not have two similar words in your language or if it would be confusing to say this twice, you can combine them into one phrase and intensify the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: “and they will burn them until they are all burned up” or “and they will burn them up completely” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## amum
### כִּ֥י (1)
Here, **For** indicates that what follows is the reason for what came before. Yahweh is reminding the reader that these things will certainly happen, because this message comes from him. If that would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## c5jr
### כִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה דִּבֵּֽר (1)
Yahweh is speaking of himself in the third person here. If that is confusing in your language, you can change it to first person, as in the UST. (See: [[figs-123person]])

# 1:19

## t8hm
### הַֽ⁠חֵל (1)
Here, the word translated as **army** can also mean “a large number of people.” In this context, the large number of people are also described as capturing territory, so they will be acting as an army. If you have a term that can mean both of these things, use it here. If not, then choose the term that fits best.

## cr35
### לִ⁠בְנֵ֨י יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל (1)
There are two possibilities for the meaning of **the sons of Israel** here. (1) In this context, **Israel** is identified as occupying territory in the north and is in contrast with **Jerusalem**, so it seems that **the sons of Israel** is referring to people who are from the northern kingdom of Israel. Alternate translation: “from northern Israel” (2) It could refer to all of the descendants of Israel. Alternate translation: “of the people of Israel” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

### וְ⁠עָל֤וּ מֽוֹשִׁעִים֙ בְּ⁠הַ֣ר צִיּ֔וֹן לִ⁠שְׁפֹּ֖ט אֶת־הַ֣ר עֵשָׂ֑ו (1)
Even though **the mountain of Zion** is a figurative name for Jerusalem, it would be good to keep the imagery of this high place in Jerusalem where God’s temple was, if possible. This would also allow the comparison with **the mountain of Esau**. Edom had boasted that it was up high and that no one could bring it down. But with this figurative imagery, Yahweh is saying that he will bring it down and place his own people up high instead. You can also choose to express this meaning in plain language if that would be clearer and if that is how you have been translating the book. Alternate translation: “Israel’s saviors will go up to Jerusalem and will rule over Edom, who thought that they were so high, from up there” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])
