### What is the Gospel of Luke about?

The Gospel of Luke is one of four books in the New Testament that describe the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. These books are called “gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Luke wrote his gospel for a person named Theophilus and dedicated it to him. Luke wrote an accurate description of the life and teachings of Jesus so that Theophilus would be certain that what he had been taught about Jesus was true. However, Luke expected that what he wrote would encourage all followers of Jesus.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Luke” or “The Gospel according to Luke.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Good News about Jesus that Luke Wrote.” (See: [[translate-names]])

### Who wrote the Book of Luke?

This book does not give the name of its author. However, the same person who wrote this book also wrote the Book of Acts, which is also dedicated to Theophilus. In parts of the book of Acts, the author uses the word “we.” This indicates that the author traveled with Paul. Most scholars think that Luke was this person traveling with Paul. Therefore, since early Christian times, most Christians have recognized Luke as the author of both the Gospel of Luke and the book of Acts.

Luke was a medical doctor. His way of writing shows that he was an educated man. He was probably a Gentile. Luke himself probably did not witness what Jesus said and did. But he tells Theophilus in his dedication that he talked to many people who did.

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts

### The kingdom of God

“The kingdom of God” is a major concept in the Gospel of Luke. It is very rich in meaning. It includes the idea of eternal life in the presence of God, but it also includes the idea of what the earth will be like in the future when God rules everything, and the idea of life on earth right now, when and where God’s wishes are carried out fully. The unifying concept behind all of these ideas is that of God ruling and of people embracing God’s rule over their lives. Wherever the expression “the kingdom of God” occurs, translation notes will suggest communicating the idea behind the abstract noun “kingdom” with some phrase that uses the verb “rule.” UST models this approach consistently. (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

### Why does Luke write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?

Luke wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

### What are the roles of women in the Gospel of Luke?

Luke described women in a very positive way in his gospel. For example, he often showed women being more faithful to God than most men. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### What are the Synoptic Gospels?

The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they tell the story of many of the same events. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”

Passages are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.

### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?

In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This is a reference to Daniel [7:13–14](../dan/07/13.md). In that passage, there is a person who is described as like a “son of man.” That means that the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to this “son of man” to rule over the nations forever. All people will worship him forever.

Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. But Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])

Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.

### Major issues in the text of the Book of Luke

ULT follows the readings of the most accurate ancient manuscripts of the Bible. However, there may already be older versions of the Bible in the translators’ regions that follow the readings of other manuscripts. In the most significant cases, the General Notes to the chapters in which these differences occur will discuss them and recommend approaches. (See: [[translate-textvariants]])
