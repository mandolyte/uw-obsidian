# Malachi 02 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Levites
The priests are given a strong warning in this chapter. They have not followed the law of Moses and have led the people in the wrong direction. Yahweh has not accepted their sacrifices. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/priest]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])

### Marital unfaithfulness
Because the Jews lived under a covenantal arrangement with Yahweh, their relationship is described using the imagery of a marriage. Marital unfaithfulness indicates a personâ€™s unfaithfulness to Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]] and [[figs-metaphor]])
