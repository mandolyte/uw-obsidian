# General Information:

As in [4:3](../04/03.md), **heads of fathers** is an abbreviated way of saying “heads of father’s houses.” Review the note there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “These are the names of the clan leaders, along with the names of their clans, of those who traveled with me” (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])
