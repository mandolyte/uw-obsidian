# Introduction to Obadiah

## Part 1: General Introduction

### Outline of the Book of Obadiah

1. Yahweh will judge Edom (1:1-16) A. Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:1–9) B. Why Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:10–14)
2. Yahweh will judge the nations (1:15–16)
3. Yahweh will deliver his people (1:17–21)

### What is the Book of Obadiah about?

After the nation of Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites (from the neighboring land of Edom) captured fleeing Jews. Then they gave these Jews over to Babylon. The Book of Obadiah is about Yahweh judging the Edomites for harming his people. This book would be comforting to the people of Judah who had been captured and forced to live in Babylon.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

This book is traditionally titled “The Book of Obadiah” or just “Obadiah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Sayings of Obadiah.” (See: [[translate-names]])

### Who wrote the Book of Obadiah?

The prophet Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about Obadiah. His name in Hebrew means “Servant of Yahweh.”

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts

### What was Edom’s relationship to Israel?

Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel’s brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were twin brothers. This made Edom’s betrayal of Israel much worse. The notes also refer to the Israelites as the people of Judah. Judah was the part of Israel that had survived the earlier destruction by the nation of Assyria and that was later captured by the nation of Babylon when the nation of Edom did not help them.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### How do I translate the concept of “pride?”

The Book of Obadiah speaks of the pride of Edom. This meant that the Edomites thought that neither their enemies nor Yahweh could defeat them. (See: [[../bible/other/proud]])

### When Obadiah is addressing Edom, should I use a singular or plural form of “you?”

Since Obadiah addressed the people of Edom figuratively by referring to them as the nation of Edom, he used a singular form in the original language. But if you are using more plain language and want your translation to be clear that it is addressing the people of Edom, you can use a plural form.
