### Confession of sin
This psalm tells of the sorrow of unconfessed sin; it also tells of the blessing of confession and of receiving God’s forgiveness. It is such a blessing when God forgives sin. Trouble comes when sin is hidden and not confessed. (See: [[../bible/kt/bless]] and [[../bible/kt/forgive]])
