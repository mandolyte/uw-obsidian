# Numbers 11 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Complaining
Moses complained about having too much responsibility. Therefore, God gave seventy men the spirit of prophecy to help Moses. The people complained about food, even though Yahweh was miraculously providing them with their food. The people complained because they did not have meat or fish to eat. God sent them quail. He punished some of the people, but it does not say why God did this. (See: [[../bible/kt/spirit]] and [[../bible/kt/prophet]])
