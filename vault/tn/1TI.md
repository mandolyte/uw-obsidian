# 1:2
## pyi6
### γνησίῳ τέκνῳ (1)
Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though they were father and son. This shows Paul’s sincere love and approval of Timothy. It is also likely that Paul personally led Timothy to trust in Christ. That would be another reason why Paul considered him to be like his own child, since Timothy entered his new life as a follower of Jesus because of Paul. Alternate translation: “who is truly like a son to me” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## rd5v
### χάρις, ἔλεος, εἰρήνη (1)
In this culture, letter writers would offer a good wish for the recipient before introducing the main business of the letter. Alternate translation: “I hope you are experiencing God’s kindness, mercy, and peace”

# 1:4
## pw2h
### μύθοις (1)
These were fanciful stories of some kind, perhaps about the supposed exploits of various spiritual beings. But since we no longer know exactly what these stories were about, it would probably be best to use a general term for them. Alternate translation: “made-up stories”

## qpv9

## p2sr
### τὴν ἐν πίστει (1)

## ar8t
### συνειδήσεως ἀγαθῆς (1)
Your translation should make it clear that love is the one goal of the command and is followed by three things that lead to this love. This is the second thing, after “a pure heart.” Alternate translation: “and from a conscience that leads a person to choose right instead of wrong”

## m53g
### πίστεως ἀνυποκρίτου (1)

# 1:6

## se38

## kz8x
### μὴ νοοῦντες (1)
If the contrast is not clear in your language between what these people want to be (teachers of the law) and their ability to do it, you may want to mark the contrast. Alternate translations: “but not understanding” or “and yet they do not understand” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## t131
### μὴ & μήτε & μήτε (1)
Paul uses a triple negative in Greek for emphasis here, “not … neither … nor.” None of these negatives cancel each other to create a positive meaning. Instead, the negative meaning is retained throughout. If your language uses double negatives for emphasis that do not cancel one another, it would be appropriate to use that construction here. (See: [[figs-doublenegatives]])

## t132
### ἃ λέγουσιν, μήτε περὶ τίνων διαβεβαιοῦνται (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. Paul uses the repetition for emphasis. You do not need to put both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “the things that they say so confidently are true” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## t141
### πατρολῴαις καὶ μητρολῴαις, ἀνδροφόνοις (1)
In this list Paul uses several compound words to express his meaning concisely and vividly.

Alternate translation: “and for people who do anything else that is against wholesome teaching”

## t147
### τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ διδασκαλίᾳ (1)
This is a figurative way to say that the teaching is good and reliable in every way and has no defect or corruption. A person with a healthy mind would recognize this teaching as correct. Alternate translation: “correct teaching” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

Use a natural way in your language to indicate that this sentence provides a contrast to the previous sentence. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## t222
### σωθήσεται (1)
Here, **she** likely refers to Eve, mentioned in the preceding verse, and whom Paul describes as “the woman.” “They,” later in the sentence, refers to women in general. To show how Paul shifts the topic from Eve, a representative woman, to all women, the word **she** could be translated here as “women.”

## u8iv
### σωθήσεται & διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας (1)
This could mean one of three things: (1) It may be that people thought that women would be condemned because of Eve’s sin and punished even more than with the pain of childbearing (see Genesis 3:16), or they may have thought that a woman who believed in Jesus was no longer under the punishment that God gave in Genesis 3:16. Since the Greek word translated **through** can also mean “with” or “while,” Paul may be saying here that women continue to have the punishment of pain in childbirth but will be saved from additional punishment as long as they have faith in Jesus. (2) It may be that the women of the church in Ephesus were being led away from faith in Jesus by the false teachers (see 2 Timothy 3:6), so Paul is recommending that they focus on raising their families rather than listening to (or participating in) the “foolish talk” (1:6). (3) **Childbearing** could also be a reference to the birth of Jesus as a human child to be the Savior. Alternate translations: (1) “God will save women, although they do have to endure childbirth” or (2) “God will save women as they attend to their families” or (3) “God will save women through Jesus, who was born as a child”

## i0ap
### διὰ τῆς τεκνογονίας (1)

## sl57
### ἐν πίστει, καὶ ἀγάπῃ, καὶ ἁγιασμῷ (1)

Paul uses this phrase to introduce a direct quotation.

## n5lt
### εἰ δέ τις τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου προστῆναι οὐκ οἶδεν, πῶς ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ ἐπιμελήσεται? (1)
Paul is making a statement, not actually asking a question. He does not expect Timothy to explain how a man who could not manage his own household could take care of God’s church. Instead, Paul is using the question form to emphasize how important it is for an overseer to demonstrate faithfulness in his personal life before assuming a leadership role in the church. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate these words as a statement. Alternate translation: “I say this because a man who is not able to manage his own household will certainly not be able to take care of the church of God” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## c814
### ἐκκλησίας Θεοῦ (1)

## p9u4
### ἵνα εἰδῇς πῶς δεῖ ἐν οἴκῳ Θεοῦ ἀναστρέφεσθαι (1)

The terms **pillar** and **support** mean basically the same thing. They are architectural features that hold up parts of buildings. Paul uses the terms together for emphasis.

## w473
### μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον (1)

## t271
### μέγα ἐστὶν τὸ τῆς εὐσεβείας μυστήριον (1)

## fhd6
### διὰ λόγου Θεοῦ (1)
In this context, the term **word** has a specific meaning. It refers to the pronouncement that God made in his word that everything that he created was good. Alternate translation: “because of what God said about it” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## t300
### καὶ ἐντεύξεως (1)
In context, the implication is that this refers to prayers of thanksgiving to God for food. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and because of the thanks that people offer to God for it in prayer” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 4:6
## ks5x
### ταῦτα ὑποτιθέμενος τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς (1)
Paul speaks of his instructions as if they were objects that could be physically placed in front of the other believers. Alternate translation: “if you help the believers remember these things” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## hfx3
### ταῦτα (1)
This refers to the teaching that began in [3:16](../03/16.md).

## h6qr

## t304
### ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say what is doing the action. Alternate translation: “the statements of what we believe, expessed in proper teaching, are causing you to trust more strongly in Christ” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## f8vs
### ἐντρεφόμενος τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας ᾗ παρηκολούθηκας (1)

## ny78
### τοῖς λόγοις τῆς πίστεως, καὶ τῆς καλῆς διδασκαλίας (1)

## th4i
### τοὺς & βεβήλους καὶ γραώδεις μύθους (1)
See how you translated **myths** in [1:4](../01/04.md) and **profane** in [1:9](../01/09.md). Alternate translation: “foolish, made-up stories in which nothing is sacred”

## elk7
### τοὺς & γραώδεις μύθους (1)
The term **old-womanish** is an idiom that means “silly” or “foolish.” Paul tells Timothy in [5:2](../05/02.md) that he should respect older women as mothers, so Paul’s expression here should be recognized as idiomatic rather than disrespectful. Your language may have a similar expression. Alternate translation: “old wives’ tales” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## sea5
### γύμναζε & σεαυτὸν πρὸς εὐσέβειαν (1)
Paul tells Timothy figuratively to work to develop godly character as if he were an athlete improving his physical conditioning. Alternate translation: “diligently practice acting in ways that please God” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 4:8
## t311
### γὰρ (1)
What follows after this word is a direct quotation of a saying that Paul uses for teaching. It may be helpful to your readers if you indicate this by setting off the words that follow in the rest of the verse with quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language may use to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## df19
### ἐπαγγελίαν ἔχουσα (1)
Alternate translation: “will bring benefits”

# 4:9
## t315
### πιστὸς ὁ λόγος (1)
As in [1:15](../01/15.md) and [3:1](../03/01.md), in this context, the term **word** means “statement” or “saying.” (Paul is referring to the entire saying that he quoted in the previous verse.) Alternate translation: “this statement is dependable”

## hc1t
### καὶ πάσης ἀποδοχῆς ἄξιος (1)
See how you translated this in [1:15](../01/15.md). Alternate translations: “and we should believe it without any doubt” or “and we should have full confidence in it”

# 4:10
## l2yl
### εἰς τοῦτο γὰρ (1)
The term **this** refers to “godliness,” which Paul mentions in the previous two verses. Paul is giving a reason why Timothy should believe the saying about the value of godliness. He and his other fellow workers are striving very hard to become godly, so it must be valuable. Alternate translation: “after all, it is for godliness that” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## c9db
### κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα (1)
The terms **toil** and **struggle** mean basically the same thing. Paul uses them together to emphasize the intensity with which he and his fellow workers are serving God. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these terms. Alternate translation: “we work so hard” (See: [[figs-doublet]])

## t320
### κοπιῶμεν καὶ ἀγωνιζόμεθα (1)
This could be the one place where **we** does not include the addressee. Paul has just told Timothy to make godliness his priority rather than physical exercise, and he may be offering himself and his other fellow workers as an example of that for Timothy to follow. So if your language makes that distinction, you may wish to use the exclusive form in this phrase. However, **we** in the next phrase would include Timothy, since Paul is encouraging Timothy to join him and his fellow workers in making godliness his priority as someone who, like them, has hoped in the living God. (See: [[figs-exclusive]])

## qmj6
### Θεῷ ζῶντι (1)
See how you translated this in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translations: “the God who is genuinely alive” or “the true God” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## t322
### ἀνθρώπων (1)
Paul uses the term **men** here in a generic sense that includes both men and women. Alternate translation: “people” (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

# 4:12
## qi8l
### μηδείς σου τῆς νεότητος καταφρονείτω (1)

## t325
### ἐν λόγῳ (1)
In this context, the term **word** means “what you say.” Alternate translation: “in your speech”

# 4:13
## t326
### πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ (1)
If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say explicitly what Timothy is to read and to whom, and whom he is to exhort and teach. Alternate translation: “continue reading the Scriptures to the people in the church there, exhorting them, and teaching them” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## kky7
### πρόσεχε τῇ ἀναγνώσει, τῇ παρακλήσει, τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate the abstract nouns **reading**, **exhortation**, and **teaching** with verbal phrases.

# 4:14

## t22x
### μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος (1)
Paul speaks of Timothy as if he were a container that could hold God’s gift. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## hdd9
### μὴ ἀμέλει τοῦ ἐν σοὶ χαρίσματος (1)
The implication is that this **gift** is the ability that God has given Timothy for ministry. Alternate translation: “do not neglect the ability that God has given you” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## xp1k
### ὃ ἐδόθη σοι διὰ προφητείας (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “which you received when leaders of the church prophesied about you” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## rr8f
### ἐπιθέσεως τῶν χειρῶν τοῦ πρεσβυτερίου (1)
Paul is speaking of a ceremony during which the church leaders put their hands on Timothy and prayed that God would enable him to do the work he had commanded him to do. Alternate translation: “when the elders all laid their hands on you” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

# 4:15
## sbcg
### ταῦτα (1)

Paul is speaking figuratively as if Timothy could physically be inside the instructions he has just given him. Alternate translation: “and follow them consistently” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## merc
### σου ἡ προκοπὴ (1)

## uq6c
### ἔπεχε σεαυτῷ καὶ τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ (1)

## zxe7
### ἐπίμενε αὐτοῖς (1)
Alternate translation: “continue to do these things”

## u7ez
### καὶ σεαυτὸν σώσεις καὶ τοὺς ἀκούοντάς σου (1)
Possible meanings are: (1) Timothy will save himself and those who hear him from God’s judgment or (2) Timothy will protect himself and those who hear him from the influence of false teachers. Perhaps Paul means both things since, if Timothy can persuade the people of the church in Ephesus not to listen to the false teachers, then he will also spare them from God’s judgment for the wrong things they would have done if they had listened to those teachers. Alternate translation: “you will keep both yourself and your listeners from believing and doing the wrong things”

## ivl7
### ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνίᾳ (1)

# 5:4
## vv64
### τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα (1)
Here, these **children** and **grandchildren** are adults who are able to care for others, not young children.

## w38h
### πρῶτον (1)
This could mean one of two things, or possibly both: (1) It could mean that, of all of their religious duties, taking care of their family is the most important one and the one that they should learn to do before anything else. Alternate translation: “as the most basic part of belonging to God’s people” or (2) It could mean that these children and grandchildren should be the first ones to take care of their family members, before the rest of the congregation. Alternate translation: “before the church offers any support”

## fnab
### μανθανέτωσαν & εὐσεβεῖν (1)
Here, **learn** means to practice, that is, to learn by doing. Alternate translation: “let them become proficient in honoring”

## t344
### μανθανέτωσαν & τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν, καὶ ἀμοιβὰς ἀποδιδόναι τοῖς προγόνοις (1)
There are two possible meanings here: (1) These two phrases may mean similar things and you could combine them if that would be clearer in your language. If **honor** is an idiom for “provide” here, as in the previous verse, then Paul may be using repetition for emphasis. Alternate translation: “let them provide the support that their widowed mother or grandmother needs and deserves” or (2) However, there may be a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. Paul may actually be giving two reasons why people should support their widowed mothers or grandmothers. Alternate translation: “this is a respectful thing to do for widowed family members, and it will repay them for supporting their children and grandchildren as they were growing up” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## g5mu
### τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον (1)
Paul uses this phrase figuratively to refer to family members, by association to the way they live in the same house. Alternate translations: “their own family members” or “those living in their homes” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## t347
### γάρ (1)

## t348
### τοῦτο & ἐστιν ἀπόδεκτον ἐνώπιον τοῦ Θεοῦ (1)
Paul uses the expression **before God**, which means “in front of God,” to mean “where God can see.” Alternate translations: “this is pleasing in God’s view” or “this pleases God” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 5:5
## xp1u
### ἡ & ὄντως χήρα καὶ μεμονωμένη (1)
The two words **genuine** and **left-alone** work together to describe one condition, and they may be combined if that is clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “a widow who is genuinely alone” Or it may be that **left-alone** further defines **genuine**. Alternate translation: “a real widow, that is, one who has no family” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## ggk0
### ἡ & χήρα (1)
Here, **the … widow** does not refer to any specific widow, but to all widows who meet this description. Alternate translations: “any … widow” or “all … widows”

## u1lj
### προσμένει ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς (1)
Paul leaves a verb unexpressed here that your language might need to express. Alternate translations: “continues in making requests and prayers” or “continues to make requests and to offer prayers” (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])

## rwp4
### ταῖς δεήσεσιν καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς (1)
The phrase **requests and prayers** expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **requests** tells what kind of **prayers** Paul is talking about here. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translations: “making requests to God in prayer” or “praying to God for what she needs” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]]).

## rb9f
### νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας (1)
The words **night** and **day** are used together to mean that she prays to God often, no matter what time it is. It does not mean that she prays all night and all day without ever stopping. Alternate translation: “at all times” (See: [[figs-merism]])

# 5:6
## t353
### ἡ & σπαταλῶσα (1)
Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to describe a certain kind of widow. It does not refer to a specific person. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “any widow who lives wantonly and extravagantly” (See: [[figs-nominaladj]])

## qy5h
### ζῶσα τέθνηκεν (1)
Paul speaks figuratively about people who do not seek to please God as if they were dead. Alternate translation: “has died in her spirit, even though she is still alive physically” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 5:7
## qw6m
### καὶ ταῦτα παράγγελλε, ἵνα ἀνεπίλημπτοι ὦσιν (1)
This statement seems to refer back to [4:11](../04/11.md), “Command and teach these things,” which Paul tells Timothy after telling him in [4:6](../04/06.md) to “place these things before the brothers.” So **they** seems to refer to all the believers in this situation, including the widows, their families, and the local church that is supposed to organize the list of widows and make sure that the widows are cared for well. Alternate translation: “also give these instructions to the believers, so that no one will be able to accuse them of doing anything wrong”

# 5:8
## p7h2
### τις τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα οἰκείων οὐ προνοεῖ (1)
Here, **his own** is an idiom that means “his own relatives.” Alternate translation: “a person does not help with his relatives’ needs, and especially those of the family members living in his home” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## y645
### τὴν πίστιν ἤρνηται (1)
Here, **the faith** refers to believing in Jesus and obeying him. Paul explains that this action would be equivalent to denying all of this. Alternate translations: “by doing that, he denies that he belongs to Jesus” or “he has shown that he does not follow the Messiah” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## evm7
### ἔστιν ἀπίστου χείρων (1)
The implication is that this person is worse than an unbeliever because even unbelievers take care of their own relatives. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “is worse than those who do not believe in Jesus, because they do take care of their relatives” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 5:9
## s8ql
### χήρα καταλεγέσθω (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “have the church put a widow on the register” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## khe1
### χήρα καταλεγέσθω (1)
There seems to have been a list of widows who had no family to help them. The church members met these women’s needs for food, clothing, and shelter, and these women then devoted their lives to serving the Christian community. If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “have the church put a woman on the list of widows who truly need help” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## i27x
### μὴ ἔλαττον ἐτῶν ἑξήκοντα γεγονυῖα (1)
Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a word that is the opposite of the intended meaning. Alternate translation: “if she is at least sixty years old” (See: [[figs-litotes]])

## q9dj
### ἑνὸς ἀνδρὸς γυνή (1)
Like the similar expression in [3:2](../03/02.md), this means that she has only one husband, and may also means that she was only married once. (If it means the second possibility, it is not clear whether Paul means to exclude women who were married more than once and widowed each time, or more specifically women who divorced their husbands and married other men.) Alternate translations: (1) “she was always faithful to her husband” or (2) “she had one husband” (See: [[figs-idiom]])

# 5:10
## l8nm
### ἐν ἔργοις καλοῖς μαρτυρουμένη (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who did the action. Alternate translation: “people must be able to attest to her good deeds” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## mik7
### ἐξενοδόχησεν (1)
Alternate translations: “has welcomed strangers into her home” or “practiced hospitality”

## ygl3
### ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν (1)
In this culture, people walked barefoot or in sandals on roads that were dusty or muddy, so washing their feet once they entered a home was a way of helping them be comfortable and clean. If the people of your culture would not be familiar with this practice, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: “has cared for believers who visited her” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## t366
### ἁγίων πόδας ἔνιψεν (1)
Paul may be using one type of humble service figuratively to represent humble service in general. Alternate translation: “has done humble things to help other believers” (See: [[figs-synecdoche]])

## bw4h

## h96j
### παντὶ ἔργῳ ἀγαθῷ ἐπηκολούθησεν (1)

## rv5h
### νεωτέρας δὲ χήρας παραιτοῦ (1)
Alternate translation: “But do not add the names of widows who are younger than 60 years old to the list of widows”

## vqq9
### ὅταν & καταστρηνιάσωσιν τοῦ Χριστοῦ (1)
The implication is that when a widow accepted a place on the register, she promised to remain unmarried and devote herself to serving other believers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly. Alternate translation: “when they feel bodily desires that are contrary to their pledge of chastity” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 5:12
## t372
### ἔχουσαι κρίμα (1)
Alternate translation: “and so they incur God’s judgment”

## nha7
### τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν (1)
The term **pledge** here refers to a commitment that the widows made, as the last note to [5:11](../05/11.md) explains, that they would serve the Christian community for the rest of their lives and not remarry if the community would supply their needs. Alternate translations: “they have not kept their prior commitment” or “they have not done what they had previously promised to do”

### περιερχόμεναι τὰς οἰκίας (1)
Alternate translation: “going from house to house”

## nll4
### φλύαροι καὶ περίεργοι, λαλοῦσαι τὰ μὴ δέοντα (1)
These three phrases may be ways of speaking about the same activity. Paul may be using repetition to emphasize that these women should not be looking into the private lives of people and telling about them to others who would be no better off after hearing this gossip. If you think it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these phrases into a single one. Alternate translation: “people who interfere openly in other people’s business” (See: [[figs-doublet]]) (A doublet can consist of more than two terms.)

## cym5
### φλύαροι (1)
Alternate translation: “people who talk nonsense”

# 5:14
## u94k
### τῷ ἀντικειμένῳ (1)
This expression could refer by implication to (1) Satan (that is the reading of UST) or (2) collectively to unbelievers who are opposing the followers of Jesus. Alternate translations: (1) “the devil” or (2) “unbelievers who are opposing you”

# 5:15
## fy54
### ἐξετράπησαν ὀπίσω τοῦ Σατανᾶ (1)
Paul speaks of living in faithfulness to Christ as if it were a path that one can either follow or turn aside from. He means that some younger widows have stopped obeying Jesus and have started to do what Satan would want them to do instead. Alternate translation: “have stopped living in obedience to Jesus and have decided to obey Satan” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 5:16
## g8k5

Paul is using this participle, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to a class of people that it describes. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate it with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: “any woman who believes in Jesus” (See: [[figs-nominaladj]])

## mf4s

## y6hf
### καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία (1)
Paul speaks figuratively of the community having to help more people than it is able to help as if it were carrying too much weight on its back. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## t384
### καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form. Alternate translations: “so that the church will not have more work than it can do” or “so that the Christian community will not have to support widows whose families could provide for them” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## u93q
### οἱ καλῶς προεστῶτες πρεσβύτεροι & ἀξιούσθωσαν (1)
If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you could say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “All believers should consider elders who are good leaders to be deserving” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## wp9d
### διπλῆς τιμῆς (1)
Here, **double honor** means either: (1) that the congregation should honor the elders in two ways, or (2) that they should honor them twice as much as others. Since Paul quotes two Scriptures in the next verse that support the idea of church leaders being paid for their work, the first possibility is more likely. Alternate translations: (1) “of both respect and payment for their work” or (2) “of more respect than others receive” (See: [[figs-abstractnouns]])

## r8ew
### οἱ κοπιῶντες (1)
Paul is using the participle **toiling**, which functions as an adjective, as a noun to refer to members of a class of people that it describes.

## t389
### ἐν λόγῳ καὶ διδασκαλίᾳ (1)
This phrase may be expressing a single idea by using two phrases (which are actually just two words in Greek) connected with **and**. The phrase **in the word** would be identifying the content of the **teaching**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: “at teaching from the Scriptures” (See: [[figs-hendiadys]])

## t390
### λόγῳ (1)
Paul may be using the term **word** here figuratively to describe the Scriptures, which God inspired people to put into words. Alternate translation: “the Scriptures” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

### βοῦν ἀλοῶντα οὐ φιμώσεις (1)
Paul is quoting this passage figuratively.

(See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## g985
### φιμώσεις (1)
A **muzzle** is a sleeve that goes over an animal’s snout to prevent it from opening its jaws and eating while it is doing work.

## t405

Grammatically, this could refer either to the instructions Paul has just given Timothy about elders or to the instructions he is about to give Timothy regarding his own personal conduct.

## pyl8
### μηδὲ κοινώνει ἁμαρτίαις ἀλλοτρίαις (1)

Alternate translation: “so that you do not become responsible for the moral and leadership failures of others” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 5:23

Alternate translation: “are clear to everyone, even before the church leaders confront them” (See: [[figs-personification]])

Alternate translation: “but the sins of some people remain hidden for a long time” This latter alternative also allows the possibility that Paul is referring to judgment by God. (See: [[figs-personification]])

# 5:25
## pd8v
### καὶ τὰ ἔργα τὰ καλὰ πρόδηλα (1)
