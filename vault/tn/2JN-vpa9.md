# Introduction to 2 John

## Part 1: General Introduction

### Outline of the Book of 2 John

1. Opening of letter (1:1-3)
2. Encouragement and the commandment to love one another (1:4-6)
3. Warning about false teachers (1:7–11)
4. Closing of letter (1:12-13)

### Who wrote the Book of 2 John?

The author of this letter identifies himself only as “the elder.” However, the content of 2 John is similar to the content in John’s gospel. This suggests that the apostle John wrote this letter, and he would have done so near the end of his life.

### To whom was the Book of 2 John written?

The author addresses this letter to someone he calls “the chosen lady” and to “her children” (1:1). Although this could refer to a specific woman and her children, that interpretation is unlikely. More probably, this is a figurative way to refer to a specific congregation and its members. This interpretation is supported by the way that John refers to the congregation with him as “the children of your chosen sister” in verse 13. This would be a readily understandable metaphor, since the word for “church” in Greek is a feminine noun. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

### What is the book of 2 John about?

It appears that John addressed this letter to a specific congregation of believers. John’s purpose in writing this letter to them was to warn his audience about false teachers. John did not want believers helping or giving money to false teachers.
He probably intended this message to be passed on to all believers in general.

### How should the title of this book be translated?

Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 John” or “Second John.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “The Second Letter from John” or “The Second Letter John Wrote.” (See: [[translate-names]])

## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts

### What is hospitality?

Hospitality was an important concept in the ancient Near East. It was important to be friendly towards foreigners or outsiders and provide help to them if they needed it. John wanted believers to offer hospitality to guests. However, he did not want believers to offer hospitality to false teachers.

### Who were the people John spoke against?

The people John spoke against may have been those who later became known as Gnostics. These people believed that the physical world was evil. Since the physical body was seen as evil, they did not think that God could become human. Therefore, they believed that Jesus was divine but denied that he was human.

## Part 3: Important Translation Issues

### What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 2 John?

In [1:12](../01/12.md), most modern versions of the Bible read “our joy.” There is another traditional reading that says “your joy.” If a version of the Bible already exists in your region, you should consider using the reading of that version in your translation. If not, you may wish to follow the reading that most Bible scholars consider to be authentic and say “our joy.” In this case, “our” would include both John and the letter recipients.
