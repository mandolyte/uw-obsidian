# General Information:

In verses 3 and 4, the author gives background information about the Pharisees’ washing traditions in order to show why the Pharisees were bothered that Jesus’ disciples did not wash their hands before eating. This information can be reordered in order to make it easier to understand, as in the UST. (See: [[writing-background]] and [[translate-versebridge]])
