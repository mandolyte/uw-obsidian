# General Information:

In several places the book uses the terms **built and complete** to mean constructed. (Review the note about this at [5:11](../05/11.md) if that would be helpful.) But this expression means something different. The elders use a different verb for the second element that means, after **not**, that the temple was only partially rebuilt, and then the work was interrupted. It would probably be helpful to your readers to show this difference in your translation. Alternate translation: “And ever since then, we have been trying to rebuild the temple, but we still have much work to do on it”
