### Genealogies

Genealogies (verse 9) are lists that record a personâ€™s ancestors or descendants, and show from what tribe and family a person came. For example, priests came from the tribe of Levi and the family of Aaron. Some of these lists included stories of ancestors and even of spiritual beings. These lists and stories were used to argue about where things came from and about how important various people were.
