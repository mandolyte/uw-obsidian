# Jeremiah 05 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 5:1-31.

## Important figures of speech in this chapter
### Hyperbole
It is possible that Yahweh is using the word “a” (meaning “even one”) as hyperbole when he states, “If you can find a man or anyone who is acting justly and trying to act faithfully, then I will forgive Jerusalem.” The purpose of this is to show how evil Jerusalem had become. (See: [[figs-hyperbole]], [[../bible/kt/justice]], [[../bible/kt/faith]] and [[../bible/kt/forgive]] and [[../bible/kt/evil]])

### Rhetorical questions
Yahweh asks several rhetorical questions in this chapter. This is intended to show Jeremiah the justness of his actions. (See: [[figs-rquestion]])
