# Luke 04 General Notes

## Structure and formatting

1. The devil tempts Jesus in the wilderness (4:1–13)
2. Jesus teaches in the synagogue in Nazareth (4:14–30)
3. Jesus teaches, heals, and drives out demons in Capernaum (4:31–44)

Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. ULT does this with the poetry in 4:10-11 and 4:18-19, which is quoted from the Old Testamentt.

## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter

### “Jesus was tempted by the devil”
While it is true that the devil actually believed that he could persuade Jesus to disobey God and obey him instead, it is important not to imply in your translation that Jesus would ever really have wanted to obey the devil.
