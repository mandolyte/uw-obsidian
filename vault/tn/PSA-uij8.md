# Psalm 051 General Notes
## Type of psalm

Psalm 51 is a psalm of repentance from sin. (See: [[../bible/kt/repent]] and [[../bible/kt/sin]])

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Repentance
The psalmist is truly sorry for having sinned. He repented and God forgave his sins. God wants true sorrow for having sinned, not sacrifices. (See: [[../bible/kt/true]] and [[../bible/kt/forgive]])

### Author of Psalm
Scholars are divided over whether this psalm was authored by King David as is mentioned by the superscription. If nothing else, we can assume the last two verses were added later since Jerusalem is intact with well-built walls during King Davidâ€™s reign.
