# Connecting Statement:

This verse contains the first two of three items Moses warns the people to be careful of ([Deuteronomy 8:11](./11.md)): that “your heart becomes lifted up” and “you forget Yahweh your God.” It then lists the first of four characteristics of Yahweh that they need to remember, that Yahweh “brought you out of the land of Egypt.”
