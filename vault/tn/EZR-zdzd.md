# General Information:

**Change** could mean giving different instructions from what the king had commanded, but it could also mean doing something other than what his decree commands. [6:12](../06/12.md) suggests that changing could mean destroying the temple rather than ensuring that it was rebuilt and maintained. Alternate translation: “if anyone disobeys this edict” (See: [[figs-idiom]])
