# 2 Samuel 21 General Notes
## Structure and formatting

## Special concepts in this chapter

### Famine caused by a broken oath
When Israel first conquered the land, they promised not to kill the people of Gibeon. When Saul tried to kill them all, God caused a famine in Israel. David made amends with the people of Gideon and the famine ended. David also kept his vow to Jonathanâ€™s sons. This helps to show the wisdom of king David. Although these people were not Israelites, they believed in Yahweh. (See: [[../bible/kt/promise]], [[../bible/kt/vow]] and [[../bible/kt/wise]] and [[../bible/kt/believe]])

### Wisdom, grace and justice
David is seen to have many great qualities in this chapter. These were qualities important for a king of Israel: wisdom, grace and justice. (See: [[../bible/kt/wise]] and [[../bible/kt/grace]] and [[../bible/kt/justice]])
