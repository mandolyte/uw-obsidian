# 1 Samuel 28 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Talking to the dead

Talking to the dead was against the law of Moses. God or the Holy Spirit left Saul because of his sin and would not help him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/death]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])

## Important figures of speech in this chapter

### Rhetorical question
Samuel uses a rhetorical question to say it was useless to ask his advice since there was no way Saul could be successful with God against him: “What then do you ask me, since Yahweh has left you, and he has become your enemy?” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])
