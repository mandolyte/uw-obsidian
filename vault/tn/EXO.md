In the UST, **And the king said**, is combined with “spoke” from [verse 15](../01/15.md) because the verb for “say” is used twice before he speaks. This may be strange in some languages. If it would be unnatural to say that the king spoke or said twice, you may leave one off.

However, it is still a true question, for without Pharaoh’s daughter’s permission the child’s sister will not be able to fetch the woman. If your language has a way of forming questions that are also suggestions, use it here.

### וַ⁠יְהִי֩ בַ⁠יָּמִ֨ים הָֽ⁠רַבִּ֜ים הָ⁠הֵ֗ם (1)

### וַ⁠יָּבֹ֛א אֶל (1)
“and he arrived at” (See: [[figs-go]])

## p27s
### הַ֥ר הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים (1)
This is an associative possessive. This mountain was associated with God in some way. In [Exodus 3:12](../03/12.md) God tells Moses that he and the Israelites will serve him on this mountain. Later in the story, this promise is fulfilled and it is where God makes his covenant with Israel and gives them the 10 Commandments. So it may have been called the mountain of God in retrospect (as Moses probably wrote this book sometime after the Israelites were wandering in the wilderness). However, it is possible that the mountain was already associated with God’s presence or worship somehow before Moses went there with the flock. (See: [[figs-possession]])

# 3:2

The word **behold** here shows that Moses saw something that was very different from what he expected. He expected the bush to be burnt up completely by the fire. Consider using an interjection in your language that expresses that the next thing is a surprise. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## cbvb
### אֻכָּֽל (1)
**Being consumed** means being eaten completely until gone. In the case of fire, this is a metonym for burning completely until gone. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

This is a direct quote. It’s not specified who Moses spoke to; he may have been alone or with a group of shepherds or his family.

This is the reason Moses must stop coming close to the burning bush and take off his sandals. Your language may need to put the reason before the commands, as in, “The place on which you are standing, it is holy ground, so you must not come close to here. Take your sandals off from on your feet.”(See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

This a direct quotation. The UST continues the quotation from verse 5 rather than including an additional “he said.” This may be more natural in some languages. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## l5sy
### אָבִ֔י⁠ךָ (1)
Possible meanings are (1) “your ancestor” or (2) “your father.” If it means “your ancestor,” then the phrases following it clarify who “your father” refers to: it refers to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it means “your father,” then it refers to Moses’s own father. It most cases it will be best to translate it as “your father,” i.e. Amram, Moses’s father.

### אֶת־עֳנִ֥י עַמִּ֖⁠י (1)
There are two possessives here. 1) “affliction of … people”: This is an event-related possessive where the people are the objects of affliction. They are treated badly as slaves. 2) “my people”: This one is more difficult as it involves both ownership and the possessive of social relationship. God views his people as his possession, and he is also in relationship with them as their God because they are descended from Abraham, though at this time they may not know God as theirs.

**Faces** refers to the whole person or the presence of the person(s) who were oppressing the Israelites. If this image is used in your language, you may translate it. If a similar image is used, you may consider using it. If neither is the case, you may omit the word “face” and translate the meaning. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## xx7r
### נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו (1)
“his oppressors”

## ofxt
### כִּ֥י (1)
The conjunction is probably functioning modally here, intensifying the expression of Yahweh’s knowledge. Your translation should express Yahweh’s knowing with certainty or strength.

## mfn2
### נֹֽגְשָׂ֔י⁠ו & מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו (1)
These pronouns, **him** and **his**, refer to the Israelites as a group in the singular. They agree with “people” as a collective noun in [3:6](../03/06.md). Some languages may have to use plural pronouns. Others may have to match the pronoun’s gender to the grammatical gender of the word for “people” in their language. If necessary change “him” to “them” or change “his” to “hers” or “its” (depending on grammatical gender of “people”.) Alternate translation: “those who oppress them … their anguish” (See: [[figs-collectivenouns]])

## hkcj
### מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו (1)
This is an event-related possessive where the people (as a group: **his**) are the subjects of anguish. Your translation should express that they are in deep mental and emotional distress (anguish). (See: [[figs-possession]])

## ui28
### מַכְאֹבָֽי⁠ו (1)

## xy36
### וָ⁠אֵרֵ֞ד (1)

(See: [[figs-collectivenouns]])

## hafv
### מִ⁠יַּ֣ד (1)

## djbz
### מִ⁠יַּ֣ד מִצְרַ֗יִם (1)

## mqyp
### אֶל־אֶ֤רֶץ טוֹבָה֙ וּ⁠רְחָבָ֔ה אֶל־אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָ֑שׁ (1)
There are multiple levels of parallelism here. First, the statements, **to a good and wide land** and **to a land flowing with milk and honey** are in parallel with each other. Within each of those, **good** and **wide** are in parallel with each other and also **milk** and **honey** are in parallel with each other. Each of these levels is meant to reinforce and expand on one another. These are not examples of synonymous parallelism, and each part of the statement should be translated. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## c7fp
### חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָ֑שׁ (1)
Here, **milk** is a metonym for domestic animals and the food products obtained from them; **honey** is a metonym for the food obtained from growing plants. See UST and [the next note]([[rc://*/tn/help/exo/03/08/pxy8]]) (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

### אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָ֑שׁ (1)
God spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the milk and honey from those animals and plants were flowing through the land. If this metaphor makes sense in your language, you may translate it, if your language has metaphors that mean a land is good for producing healthy livestock and good crops, you may consider using those. If neither is the case, you may translate the meaning. See UST. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## dtz9
### זָבַ֥ת (1)
“full of” or “with an abundance of”

## q94i

Moses presents God with a hypothetical situation here. The three events (**go, say, say**) are part of one hypothetical event. You should translate this in a way that makes it clear that this is a future, not-yet-real event. (See: [[grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical]])

## jq42

# 3:15
## h97b
### וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ע֨וֹד אֱלֹהִ֜ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֗ה (1)

# 3:21
## btwc
### חֵ֥ן & בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם (1)
**In the eyes of the Egyptians** is an idiom for the Egyptian’s feelings. **Favor** means those feelings are positive. Taken together, this means that when the Egyptians see the Israelites (Hebrews) leaving Egypt, they will gladly help them (because they want them to leave so badly due to the Egyptians suffering under God’s judgement). If your language has the same or a similar idiom, you can translate or use it. Otherwise, you can translate the meaning. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## h2wf
### בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י מִצְרָ֑יִם (1)
This is a part-whole possessive. Also, if your language uses a specific form of the possessive for things one cannot lose, it would be appropriate to use that form here. (See: [[figs-possession]])

# 3:22
## w2av
### וּ⁠מִ⁠גָּרַ֣ת בֵּיתָ֔⁠הּ (1)
**Sojourning** means living somewhere other than one’s native land, usually temporarily. It is unclear both who the sojourning (visiting) women are and in whose house they are sojourning, leaving several possibilities. Most translations that make a decision about who they are identify both the temporary resident and her host home as Egyptian. This makes sense as the Israelites will be plundering the Egyptians. If it is possible to leave this ambiguous in your translation, that would be best.

## d74q

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## neto
### לֹֽא־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהוָֽה (1)
This is a second-level quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. However, you could translate it as an indirect quotation. Alternate translation: “that Yahweh has not appeared to me” (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

## c27j
### וְ⁠הֵן֙ (1)
This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “Listen to me.”

## bzmp
### שְׁלַח֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ וֶ⁠אֱחֹ֖ז בִּ⁠זְנָב֑⁠וֹ (1)
This direct quotation is interrupted by Moses obeying Yahweh. This is probably a tightly ordered sequence of events where Yahweh paused and then continued speaking immediately after Moses obeyed. The quote resumes in [verse 5](../04/05.md) and there is more discussion there about how to handle the resumption.(See: [[grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

This continues the direct quotation from the first part of [verse 4](../04/04.md). It may be more natural to reorganize verses four and five to keep the quote together. If you rearrange like this, Moses picking up the snake/staff should come after the full quotation. However, it is better to do something similar to the UST, which restates that Yahweh is speaking and provides some implied directives from Yahweh to make a complete sentence. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## m4fk
### לְמַ֣עַן יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ כִּֽי־נִרְאָ֥ה אֵלֶ֛י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם אֱלֹהֵ֧י אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִצְחָ֖ק וֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב (1)
This quote is not a complete sentence; the UST provides a clarification. (See: [[figs-ellipsis]])

## niok
### יַאֲמִ֔ינוּ & אֲבֹתָ֑⁠ם (1)
These pronouns refer either to the Israelites or to the Israelite elders. God had instructed Moses to gather and speak to the elders; if you make this participant explicit, elders is a better option. (See: [[writing-participants]])

### כַּ⁠שָּֽׁלֶג (1)
The word **like** (ULT) or “as” (UST) here is used to compare how Moses’ hand looked. You may not have a word for snow in your language.

Here the **sign**s are spoken of as if they had a **voice** with which they could speak. If this imagery would not make sense in your language you may need to translate this in a way that makes explicit that the signs are meant to be proof that God sent Moses. Alternative translation: “and are not convinced that God has appeared to you by seeing the first sign, then they will be convinced by seeing the second sign.” (See: [[figs-personification]])

His **brother** Aaron was three years older than Moses (see [Exodus 7:7](../07/07.md)), which may be important for translating “brother” in some languages. (See: [[figs-kinship]])

## y5ed
### דַבֵּ֥ר יְדַבֵּ֖ר (1)
In Hebrew, the word **speak** is repeated. This means he speaks well. English cannot convey this by doubling, so the meaning of the repetition was translated in the ULT in this case. If your language can say something like “speaking speaks” to mean “speaks well,” consider it; otherwise, translate the meaning similarly to the ULT or UST. (See: [[figs-idiom]])

## hq64
### הִנֵּה (1)
**Behold** is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. If your language has a term that functions in that way (“Listen!” or “Look!” or “Pay Attention!”), use it here.

## ettp

Yahweh says Aaron is coming from Egypt to Midian to find Moses. He is probably on foot. Depending on the language, the required form of go or come may vary. (See: [[figs-go]])

## hkn8
### וְ⁠שָׂמַ֥ח (1)
Aaron will be glad because he sees Moses. Consider a conjunction or other form that expresses result as in the UST or alternative translation: “and because he sees you, he will have joy” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## ew4h
### בְּ⁠לִבּֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Here, **heart** refers to inner thoughts and emotions. If the heart is not a body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s thoughts and emotions, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 4:15
## u97f
### הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֖ים (1)
Words here are spoken of as if they were something that can be physically placed in a person’s mouth. Alternate translation: “the message that he is to repeat” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

# 4:16
## mnsp
### לְ⁠פֶ֔ה (1)

## gn5v
### תִּֽהְיֶה־לּ֥⁠וֹ לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִֽים (1)

Jethro is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative here. (See: [[writing-participants]])

This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 4:19
## wwr8
### וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֤ה אֶל־מֹשֶׁה֙ (1)
The timing and situation for Yahweh speaking to Moses here is not specified. Some conjecture that it was part of the narrative of the encounter with Yahweh from the previous verses but placed after his request to Jethro for an unknown reason. Another speculation is that Moses delayed returning to Egypt (either by his own choice, Yahweh’s instructions, or someone else delaying him) and Yahweh came and told him again (the UST explicitly offers this optional translation). (See: [[grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

## aosm
### לֵ֖ךְ שֻׁ֣ב מִצְרָ֑יִם כִּי־מֵ֨תוּ֙ כָּל־הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ (1)

## clfj
### הַֽ⁠מְבַקְשִׁ֖ים אֶת־נַפְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ (1)
This means they were seeking to end his life, that is, to kill him. Alternate translation: see UST.

# 4:20
## fua6
### בָּנָ֗י⁠ו (1)
Moses’ second son is not introduced until [18:4](../18/.04.md) but had already been born before they left Midian. (See: [[writing-participants]])

## zi5m
### וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם (1)
It is clear from [verse 24](../04/24.md) and [25](../04/25.md) that his family went with him, so you may need to translate as “they returned.” (See: [[writing-participants]])

## d7k5
### וַ⁠יָּ֖שָׁב אַ֣רְצָ⁠ה מִצְרָ֑יִם (1)
After the incident on the road in verses [24](../04/24.md)-[26](../04/26.md), Moses’ family is not mentioned again until [18:2](../18/02.md) which says that Moses sent them back, so a translation similar to the UST which only commits to the family starting on the way to Egypt may be better. This option has the further benefit of allowing for the several events that happen before Moses gets to Egypt. The ULT’s “towards” is another way of giving space in the translation for the next several events. (See: [[grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

## s68n
### מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים (1)
The phrase the staff of God refers to the staff that God told Moses to take with him in v. [17](../04/17.md). (See: [[figs-explicit]])

## se3s
### מַטֵּ֥ה הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים (1)
The book describes this staff as **the staff of God** because God appointed it as his instrument so that Moses could do miraculous works through it. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could say that explicitly. Make sure your translation does not lead people to think the staff was a magic wand or shaman’s staff that had its own power, or power from Moses, or that the staff gave Moses the ability to command God. In every instance where miracles happened, God told Moses to do something with the staff, Moses obeyed, and then God caused a miracle. Alternate translation: “the staff that God had told him to bring because God intended to work powerfully through it when Moses stretched it out.” (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 4:21
## lva8
### בְּ⁠לֶכְתְּ⁠ךָ֙ (1)
This begins a direct quotation that continues to the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It contains up to fourth-level quotations. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## oajf
### רְאֵ֗ה (1)
Most translations and interpretations of the verb **see** take it to mean something like “see that you do.”

## zgqf
### כָּל־הַ⁠מֹּֽפְתִים֙ אֲשֶׁר־שַׂ֣מְתִּי בְ⁠יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ (1)
Here the miracles are spoken of as if they were items Moses could carry. In part, this may be because the three signs already given to Moses involved the use of his hand. Alternative translation: “all the wonders I have authorized you to perform” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## kdsb
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה (1)
This time while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses is to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so he can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see them” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## ovma
### וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק (1)
Referring to himself in the opening of this sentence serves to emphasize a contrast in what might be expected and what will happen. Translate this in a way that clearly contrasts the performance of miracles before Pharaoh (which might be expected to lead to him releasing the Israelites) with what Yahweh says he will do. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## uvoh
### וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ אֲחַזֵּ֣ק אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ (1)
This means that God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart would be made stronger. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. Alternate translation: “But as for me, I will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## uudz
### וְ⁠לֹ֥א יְשַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם (1)
Make it clear in your translation that this is a result of God hardening Pharaoh’s heart. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

# 4:22
## ftde
### כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה (1)
This is the first of hundreds of occurrences throughout the Old Testament of a standard phrase used to introduce direct, authoritative instruction from Yahweh. It would be good for your team to have a standard way to translate this that makes it clear that the words that come next are directly from God. If your language has a standard way of introducing a new message from your rulers that alerts the hearers that these are the words of the rulers, that would be a good phrase to consider.

## zb2e
### כֹּ֚ה (1)
**Thus** begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level, the first level. (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

## teyy
### כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה (1)
This begins a second-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, you may want to translate this as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “that Yahweh says” (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

### בְּנִ֥⁠י (1)
This is the beginning of a third-level quotation that continues until the end of [4:23](../04/23.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation within a quotation. (If you chose to translate, “Thus says Yahweh,” as an indirect quote, this will be a second- level quotation.) (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## aod0
### בְּנִ֥⁠י בְכֹרִ֖⁠י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל׃ (1)
Some languages may need to change the metaphor here into a simile. See UST. (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## pt4n
### יִשְׂרָאֵֽל (1)
The word **Israel** here represents all the people of Israel as a group. It is important to keep the singular reference to Israel as son, rather than change it to something like ‘the Israelites are my children,’ because God is making a particular contrast here between his son and Pharaoh’s son. Some languages may not be able to use “Israel” as a collective noun and may need to choose a translation like “the nation of Israel” or “the Israelite nation.” (See: [[figs-collectivenouns]])

## hoc8
### יִשְׂרָאֵֽל (1)
The Israelite nation is often referred to simply by the name of the patriarch. For alternative translation see: [[rc://*/tn/help/exo/04/22/pt4n]] (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 4:23
## syar
### שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי (1)
This is a fourth-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. (If you chose to translate “Thus says Yahweh” as an indirect quote, this will be a third-level quotation.) (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## zpc4
### וָ⁠אֹמַ֣ר אֵלֶ֗י⁠ךָ שַׁלַּ֤ח אֶת־בְּנִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי וַ⁠תְּמָאֵ֖ן (1)
The fourth-level quotation here may be a good one to translate as an indirect quotation in order to reduce the levels of quotations in this passage. Alternative translation: “and I told you to let my son go that he may serve me. But you have refused” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## k7mh
### בְּנִ⁠י֙ (1)
Yahweh continues to metaphorically speak of Israel as **my son.** See what you did at [[rc://*/tn/help/exo/04/22/1od0]]. Alternative translation: “the Israelite nation which is like a son to me” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## u825
### וְ⁠יַֽעַבְדֵ֔⁠נִי & לְ⁠שַׁלְּח֑⁠וֹ (1)
The pronouns **he** and **him** agree with “son.” What you use may depend on how you translated son at [[rc://*/tn/help/exo/04/23/k7mh]]. (See: [[figs-pronouns]])

## tg32
### הִנֵּה֙ (1)
This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Know this”

## re11
### בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ (1)
This refers to the actual son of Pharaoh.

## ubcw
### בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּכֹרֶֽ⁠ךָ (1)
After this phrase, the three levels of direct quotations end bringing a complete close to all quotations that started in verses [21](../04/21.md) and [22](../04/22.md). If you are using direct quotations, at the end of this verse you should have three closing markers, third level, second level and first level. In English, it looks like **” ’ ”** (without spaces). (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 4:24
## sp6h
### וַ⁠יְהִ֥י (1)
This introduces a new event. Mark the transition in a natural way in your language. (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## p820
### וַ⁠יִּפְגְּשֵׁ֣⁠הוּ & הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Here, it is not clear who **him** refers to. Most commentators believe it refers to Moses, but it could refer to the son, though that is less likely. If it is necessary to choose for your translation, use Moses. (See: [[writing-participants]])

## cxy0
### הֲמִיתֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Here, **he** refers to Yahweh. (See: [[writing-participants]])

# 4:25
## m1la

### עָרְלַ֣ת (1)
The**foreskin** is the retractable fold of skin which covers and protects the end of the penis. (See: [[translate-unknown]])

## l6sr
### לְ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו (1)
It is possible that the word **feet** may have been a more respectful way to refer to the genital area of the body. However, that possibility is not high enough that you should translate it either literally as genitals or with another euphemism meaning genitals in your language. If you have a word that means primarily feet or legs, but could in some cases also euphemistically mean genitals, you may consider it. (See: [[figs-euphemism]])

## cg3x
### כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י (1)
This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## b2t3
### כִּ֧י חֲתַן־דָּמִ֛ים אַתָּ֖ה לִֽ⁠י (1)

# 4:26
## ceqk
### וַ⁠יִּ֖רֶף (1)

## dl5u
### מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ (1)
As in [4:24](../04/24.md) this could mean either Moses or the son, but most commentators think it is still Moses. The UST uses “anyone” to preserve ambiguity. Alternative translation: “from Moses” (See: [[writing-participants]])

## r8hj
### חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים (1)
This is a unique quotation because Zipporah probably does not speak again, rather the quotation refers back to her statement in [4:25](../04/25.md). Your language may handle this sort of quotation in a special way. (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## abmg
### חֲתַ֥ן דָּמִ֖ים לַ⁠מּוּלֹֽת (1)
It is not clear if the quotation includes **because of the circumcision** or if that is a comment explaining the quotation. Translations are divided in where they end the quotation, but most exclude **because of the circumcision** and it is best to follow that unless a locally respected translation includes it. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 4:27
## xk6b
### וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר (1)

# 4:28
## ad9x
### שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ & צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ (1)
These are a bit awkward to translate in English, so the UST adds more information. Other languages may not have the same difficulty.

## b429
### שְׁלָח֑⁠וֹ & צִוָּֽ⁠הוּ (1)
The words **he** refers to Yahweh, and **him** refers to Moses. Alternative translation: “Yahweh sent Moses … Yahweh commanded Moses” (See: [[writing-participants]])

# 4:29

This time phrase, **and afterward**, marks a transition in the narrative. Alternative translation: “After that” (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## q9kn
### וְ⁠אַחַ֗ר בָּ֚אוּ מֹשֶׁ֣ה וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֔ן וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֖וּ אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֑ה (1)

## cudx
### בָּ֚אוּ (1)
In this instance, depending on how they have to set scenes, some languages may need to use “came in.” (See: [[figs-go]])

## sl1y
### פַּרְעֹ֑ה (1)
Pharaoh is reintroduced as a participant in the narrative for the first time since chapter two. Some languages may need to mark his reintroduction in a particular way. (See: [[writing-participants]])

## cl2v
### כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל שַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־עַמִּ֔⁠י וְ⁠יָחֹ֥גּוּ לִ֖⁠י בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּֽר (1)
This is a direct quotation. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with first-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 5:2
## v4c1
### וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר (1)

## lqwt
### מִ֤י יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶשְׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹל֔⁠וֹ לְ⁠שַׁלַּ֖ח אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל (1)
This is not a rhetorical question, though Pharaoh may have spoken with contempt. Pharaoh would have considered himself a go. The Egyptians had several gods, and most people groups were assumed to have their own gods. Therefore, Pharaoh had truly not heard of Yahweh (who has just told his name to Moses).

## wpff
### יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל & יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל (1)
Here the nation is spoken of as an individual. Alternative translation: “the nation of Israel” (See: [[figs-collectivenouns]])

Pharaoh uses this question to express his anger towards Moses and Aaron for taking the Israelites away from their work. Alternate translation: “Stop distracting the people from doing their work!” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## fiw9
### לְכ֖וּ לְ⁠סִבְלֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם (1)
This **your** could refer to Moses and Aaron, or it could mean “all you Israelite people.” The second meaning is more likely. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual or plural form here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

# 5:5
## nqbe
### וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר פַּרְעֹ֔ה (1)
It is unusual for the same speaker to be reintroduced like this. Some translations omit the repetition, but there is another option. This statement may be more connected to the next couple of verses, so it might be appropriate to make a minor break before this verse. Pharaoh may have been more commenting to himself, or he only thought this statement silently, and it led to his next actions. (See: [[figs-aside]])

## todi
### הֵן (1)
This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say.

## c53k

### אֶת־הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים בָּ⁠עָ֔ם וְ⁠אֶת־שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו (1)
Pharaoh may have sent a messenger or messengers to the taskmasters and officers or spoken to one or a few representatives of them at his court rather than speaking to them directly. Alternative translation: “Pharaoh gave an order for the taskmasters among the people and officers that said,”

## zd4m
### הַ⁠נֹּגְשִׂ֣ים (1)
**Taskmasters** were Egyptians whose job it was to force the Israelites to do hard work. These are probably the same as the “overseers” of labor gangs from [Exodus 1:11](../01/11.md), but here the term is harsher. Alternative translation: “oppressors”

## hopu
### שֹׁטְרָ֖י⁠ו (1)
**Officers** were probably Israelite slaves who were in charge of the other Israelites but who answered to the Egyptian taskmasters.

## djoe
### וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֥וּ אֶל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר פַּרְעֹ֔ה (1)
It might be helpful in some languages to translate **thus says Pharaoh** as an indirect quote so that his conveyed command is not a quote within a quote. Alternate translation: “and told the people that Pharaoh says” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## mkom
### אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי (1)
This is a the beginning of a second-level quotation that continues until the end of verse 11. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the start of a quotation within a quotation. However, you could also translate this as an indirect quote. See UST. (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

## szfp
### אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם תֶּֽבֶן (1)
The structure of this phrase and the one that opens [the next verse](../05/11.md) create a strong contrast between what **I** (Pharaoh) and **you** (you all, the Israelites) will do. Translate this in a way that emphasizes, if possible, the contrast between “I” and “you.” Alternative translation: “It is not I who will give you straw.” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## si2e
### אֵינֶ֛⁠נִּי (1)
Pharaoh does not physically give the Israelites straw. Rather, he had commanded his servants take straw that belongs to Pharaoh and give it to the Israelites. Now he told his servants to stop providing straw. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## gb4d
### לָ⁠כֶ֖ם (1)
**You**is plural and refers to the Israelite people. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

### אַתֶּ֗ם לְכ֨וּ קְח֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ תֶּ֔בֶן מֵ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר תִּמְצָ֑אוּ (1)
The structure of this phrase serves as the opposing side of the contrast Pharaoh sets up in the last phrase. By explicitly using a pronoun with a command, he is emphasizing who will go get straw. If possible, translate this in a way that emphasizes the contrast between “I” and “you.” See [[rc://*/tn/help/exo/05/10/7zfp]] for more info. Alternative translation: “Rather, it is you yourselves who must go get straw from wherever you might find it” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## xe4i
### אַתֶּ֗ם (1)
Here, **you** is plural and refers to the Israelite people. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

## d592
### חֶ֥רֶב בְּ⁠יָדָ֖⁠ם (1)
Here, **a sword into their hand** is a metonym for “a reason in their mind.” The Israelites are afraid that the Egyptians will feel that they are doing the right thing if they kill the Israelites because Moses and Aaron are making demands to the king and because the Egyptians view the Israelites as lazy and dangerous. Alternate translation: “them a reason to think they would be right” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## pm0l
### וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר (1)

# 5:23
## v2k2

**Hand** is a metonym for power. Alternate translation: “by a strong power … and by a strong power” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## swm5
### בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ & וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה (1)
It is not clear in the text whose **hand** is referred to here. The options are: (1) Both refer to God’s hand (forcing Pharaoh’s actions), (2) Both refer to Pharaoh’s hand (forcing the Israelites out), (3) They don’t refer to the same person’s hand; the first refers to God’s and the second to Pharaoh’s. The UST has followed (1) which is the most common interpretation. Alternate translation: (1) “by my strong hand … and by my strong hand” or (2) “by his strong hand … and by his strong hand” or (3) “by my strong hand … and by his strong hand”

## dm4g
### כִּ֣י בְ⁠יָ֤ד חֲזָקָה֙ יְשַׁלְּחֵ֔⁠ם וּ⁠בְ⁠יָ֣ד חֲזָקָ֔ה יְגָרְשֵׁ֖⁠ם מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ (1)
These two phrases mean similar things. God says the same thing twice, in similar ways, for emphasis. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that might be confusing for your readers. Instead, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let my people leave the land” However, there is a slight difference in meaning, and you could also choose to bring that out in your translation. The second phrase intensifies the first by portraying Pharaoh as not merely letting the Israelites go, but as forcing them to leave the land. Alternate translation: “I will force him to let them go, in fact, I will force him to force them to leave his land” (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## sdon
### מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ (1)
“from Egypt”

# 6:2
## fm1a
### וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו (1)
There is a transition here. Before this verse, Yahweh was answering Moses’ question more directly. At the beginning of this verse, Yahweh is reintroduced as “God” because he begins to make a clarifying statement about himself and his relationship with the Israelites and their ancestors as well as his plans for the Israelites. Much of this section repeats what Yahweh has already told Moses. You may want to consider a section break before this verse. (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## kcty
### וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־מֹשֶׁ֑ה וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֵלָ֖י⁠ו (1)
After this phrase a direct quote begins which continues until the end of [verse 8](../06/08.md).

(See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 6:3
## l81y
### בְּ⁠אֵ֣ל שַׁדָּ֑י (1)
This is a title for God that many scholars think means “almighty.” You will need to decide if you will transliterate the term into your language or translate the meaning. Either approach has broad support. Alternative translation: “as the strongest God of all” (See: [[translate-transliterate]])

## m27p
### וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם (1)
This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “but they did not know me by my name Yahweh” (See: [[figs-activepassive]])

## e36z
### וּ⁠שְׁמִ֣⁠י יְהוָ֔ה לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖עְתִּי לָ⁠הֶֽם (1)
This statement is very difficult to understand as God’s name, Yahweh, is used throughout Genesis, including by Abraham and others. There are many theories about what it means; the view followed by the UST is that now God is revealing to the Israelites a fuller meaning of his divine name than what Abraham and others knew. Alternate translation: “but my name Yahweh was not understood by them”

# 6:4
## zxvc
### לָ⁠תֵ֥ת לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן (1)

## gkkc
### אֶ֥רֶץ מְגֻרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־גָּ֥רוּ בָֽ⁠הּ (1)

# 6:6
## rgh0
### לָ⁠כֵ֞ן (1)
God is now telling Moses to deliver a message to the Israelites of what God is going to do because of everything that he said in verses 2-5. The reason-result relationship is strongly marked here, so translations should make sure to use a connector that marks verse 6-8 as a result of verses 2-5. Alternate translation: “Because of this” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## yv14
### לָ⁠כֵ֞ן אֱמֹ֥ר לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֘ל (1)

## efx1
### וּ⁠בִ⁠שְׁפָטִ֖ים (1)
Here, the term **judgments** refers to the plagues that God is about to send to harm Egypt and the Egyptians. Each plague is a response to Pharaoh’s stubbornness. Alternate translation: “and by [greatly] harming the Egyptians”

### נָשָׂ֨אתִי֙ אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י (1)
This is an action that signifies making an oath. Raising the hand may not have the same meaning in your culture so you may need to use a different symbolic oath-taking action in your translation, or simply translate the meaning. Alternate translation: “I promised” (See: [[translate-symaction]])

## i3vj
### מוֹרָשָׁ֖ה (1)
This means the Israelites will own the land. Alternate translation: “as your own land”

## ipnm
### אֲנִ֥י יְהוָֽה (1)
After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh ends. Both the first-level and second-level quotes end. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with a closing first-level and second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## zjc7
### מִ⁠קֹּ֣צֶר ר֔וּחַ (1)

## fxf2
### וִֽ⁠ישַׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ (1)
This is an indirect quote; in some languages you will have to make it a direct quote. Be careful to change the third-person pronouns to second-person pronouns if you do this. Alternate translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## iiui
### הֵ֤ן (1)
**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”

## k7hl

Alternate translation: “Since the sons of Israel have not listened to me, why would you think Pharaoh would listen to me?” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## k3br
### וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י עֲרַ֥ל שְׂפָתָֽיִם (1)

## no6g
### וַ⁠יְצַוֵּ⁠ם֙ אֶל־בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אֶל־פַּרְעֹ֖ה (1)
This phrase is somewhat difficult to translate. Here, **command** could also be translated as “charge” or “commission.” Another difficulty is knowing to whom the command is directed: is it to Moses and Aaron or are they to give the command to Pharaoh and the Israelites, thus **to** could be translated as “for” or “regarding” Alternate translations: “and he charged them regarding the sons of Israel and regarding Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a command for the sons of Israel and for Pharaoh” or “and he gave them a commission to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh”

### הֵ֤ן (1)
**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation, or you can use an alternate translation like “as you know.”

## a8l8
### אֲנִי֙ עֲרַ֣ל שְׂפָתַ֔יִם (1)
This is a metaphor that means that Moses thought he was not a good speaker. It is somewhat crude, and your translation of this phrase could convey that Moses spoke impolitely. See how you translated this in [6:12](../06/12.md) Alternate translation: “And I always fail to speak well” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

(See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## gy1t
### רְאֵ֛ה (1)
This is used to draw attention to surprising information that follows. Alternative translation: “Listen carefully”

## dn1s
### נְתַתִּ֥י⁠ךָ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לְ⁠פַרְעֹ֑ה (1)
This means Moses would represent the same authority to Pharaoh as God did to Moses. See how you translated the very similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md), see [this note]([[rc://*/tn/help/exo/04/16/gn5v]]). Alternate translation: “I will cause Pharaoh to consider you as a god” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## z163
### וְ⁠אַהֲרֹ֥ן אָחִ֖י⁠ךָ יִהְיֶ֥ה נְבִיאֶֽ⁠ךָ (1)
This phrase compares Aaron to a prophet because he will be the one actually to proclaim to Pharaoh what Moses tells him. See how you translated a similar phrase in [Exodus 4:16](../04/16.md), see [this note]([[rc://*/tn/help/exo/04/16/mnsp]]). Alternate translation: “and Aaron your brother will act like your prophet” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## hdwo
### וְ⁠שִׁלַּ֥ח אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ (1)
Some languages may need to make this a direct quote. If so, be sure to mark it as a second-level quotation, subordinate to Yahweh’s main speech. Alternative translation: “saying, ‘You must let the sons of Israel go from your land’” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## t04o
### מֵ⁠אַרְצֽ⁠וֹ (1)
“Egypt”

# 7:3
## adsq
### אַקְשֶׁ֖ה אֶת־לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה (1)
This means God will make him stubborn. His stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart were hard. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being strong vs. hard. Alternate translation: “will cause Pharaoh to be stubborn” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## vtt1
### אֶת־אֹתֹתַ֛⁠י וְ⁠אֶת־מוֹפְתַ֖⁠י (1)

# 7:4
## ar0l
### אֲלֵ⁠כֶם֙ (1)
Here, **you** means Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

## nilu
### אֶת־צִבְאֹתַ֜⁠י אֶת־עַמִּ֤⁠י בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ (1)
These phrases refer to the Israelites in three different ways; they do not refer to three different groups of people. **Armies** is the same word translated “hosts” in [Exodus 6:26](../06/26.md). Alternate translation: “the armies of my Israelite people”

# 7:5
## cg3n
### וְ⁠יָדְע֤וּ מִצְרַ֨יִם֙ כִּֽי־אֲנִ֣י יְהוָ֔ה (1)

# 7:8
## pwph
### וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֔ה (1)
This verse marks the beginning of new sections, both major and minor. The major story of the plagues and Exodus itself unfolds from here until after Pharaoh’s army is defeated at the Red Sea.  The next minor event is the miracle of the rods becoming snakes. Either by using particular forms that your language uses to mark transitions or by making a section break and heading, this transition should be marked for readers.  (See: [[writing-newevent]])

## p2kf
### לֵ⁠אמֹֽר (1)

The two quotations in this verse could be stated as indirect quotes. Alternate translation: “When Pharaoh tells you to do a miracle, then you will tell Aaron to take his staff and throw it down before Pharaoh so that it may become a snake” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## ye9j
### תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת (1)
This is a second-level direct quotation. If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## r0tp
### קַ֧ח אֶֽת־מַטְּ⁠ךָ֛ וְ⁠הַשְׁלֵ֥ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה יְהִ֥י לְ⁠תַנִּֽין (1)
This is a second-level direct quotation. The second level may end after **Pharaoh.** If you did not decide to make it an indirect quotation, it may be helpful to your readers to indicate this by marking it with second-level quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate a quotation within a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## p3xh
### לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר (1)
Here, **saying** marks the beginning of a direct quote and is often omitted in translation when such a construction is unnatural in the target language. See UST.

## ms5o
### אֲלֵ⁠כֶ֤ם & לָ⁠כֶ֖ם (1)
These are plural, referring to Moses and Aaron. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a dual form (if you have one) or plural form (if not) here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

## ghfg
### תְּנ֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם מוֹפֵ֑ת (1)
This is a second-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer level. (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

## ogk9
### לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־פַרְעֹ֖ה (1)
Although **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Moses and Aaron are to actually do the miracles in front of Pharaoh so that Pharaoh can see them. Alternative translation: “so Pharaoh can see it” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

# 7:10
## dq7r
### לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י פַרְעֹ֛ה וְ⁠לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו (1)
This time, while **before the face of** still has the standard figurative meaning of “in the presence of,” it is a much more literal use here. Aaron actually does this right in front of Pharaoh and his servants so they could watch what happens. Alternative translation: “where Pharaoh and his servants could see it” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## cdkq
### עֲבָדָ֖י⁠ו (1)
**His servants** probably refers to important advisors that would be in the king’s court, and does not refer common servants.

### לַֽ⁠חֲכָמִ֖ים וְ⁠לַֽ⁠מְכַשְּׁפִ֑ים & חַרְטֻמֵּ֥י (1)
Here, **magicians** probably describes both **wise men and sorcerers** rather than being a third group. See translationWords articles for each term.

# 7:12
## u6np
### וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע (1)
“ate up” or “devoured”

## m0kw
### וַ⁠יִּבְלַ֥ע מַטֵּֽה־אַהֲרֹ֖ן אֶת־מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם (1)
This is a surprising and amusing twist which was not what the magicians expected. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

## prnp
### מַטֵּֽה & מַטֹּתָֽ⁠ם (1)
It may be necessary in some languages to translate the word **staff** as “snake” since it had turned into one. This may be true if it would not make sense in the target language to say that a staff swallowed or ate something (because it is not living). It may also be not make sense in some languages to speak of the snakes as staffs once transformed. (See: [[figs-personification]])

# 7:13
## g42f
### וַ⁠יֶּחֱזַק֙ לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֔ה (1)
Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart were **strong**. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 4:21](../04/21.md), but note that this is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn, as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## tfve
### כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָֽה (1)
Because Yahweh’s prediction precedes this event, some languages may need to place the reference to that prediction before the statement that it was fulfilled. See UST.

# 7:14
## d27r
### כָּבֵ֖ד לֵ֣ב פַּרְעֹ֑ה (1)
Yahweh speaks of Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude as if Pharaoh’s heart were heavy. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md), but note the slightly different metaphor there: the heart being heavy vs strong. Alternate translation: “Pharaoh is defiant” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

(See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## uvxe
### אֱלֹהֵ֤י הָ⁠עִבְרִים֙ (1)
Yahweh claimed the Hebrews (Israelites) as his own. They worshiped him. This is a possessive of social relationship. (See: [[figs-possession]])

This is a third-level quotation. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. Alternatively, you could translate it as an indirect quotation as in the UST. If you do this, take care to adjust the pronoun person (second/third) as appropriate. (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.

## mywj
### בְּ⁠זֹ֣את (1)
This begins a third-level quotation that continues until the end of verse 18. It should be marked in some manner that distinguishes it from the outer levels. It is possible that the third-level quote actually ends before **Behold,** in which case, in the rest of the quote **I** refers to Moses, not Yahweh. (See: [[figs-quotesinquotes]])

## jjm3
### הִנֵּ֨ה (1)
**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. Alternate translation: “Look at this”

**The river will stink** will happen because the fish die. Alternate translation: “and because of that the river will stink” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## nx0q
### וְ⁠נִלְא֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם לִ⁠שְׁתּ֥וֹת מַ֖יִם מִן־הַ⁠יְאֹֽר (1)
In some languages you will need to put the reason before the result. Alternative translation: “In order to find water to drink from the river, the Egyptians will exhaust themselves.” (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-result]])

## c50i
### וְ⁠נִלְא֣וּ מִצְרַ֔יִם (1)
Here, **themselves** refers back to the subject (**the Egyptians**) to indicated that the Egyptians are the object of the verb as well. Different languages have different methods of marking this. (See: [[figs-rpronouns]])

## grwh
### מִן־הַ⁠יְאֹֽר (1)
After this phrase, the direct quote of Yahweh’s commands ends. Depending on your decisions about the embedded quotation levels, you may have up to three levels of quotations that need to be closed here. It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with closing quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of a quotation and quotations within quotations.

This long list means “everywhere in Egypt.” It is presented in this way for rhetorical effect, that is, to convince Pharaoh of how bad this plague will be so he will obey.

After this phrase a direct quote begins which continues until the end of [9:19](../09/19.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## zmrt
### וְ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֑ה (1)

## f6cj
### וְ⁠אָמַרְתָּ֣ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים (1)
After **and say to him**, a second-level quote begins which continues until the end of [9:19](../09/19.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening second-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation within a quotation. However, it may be useful to translate this short quote frame as an indirect quotation as the UST does. (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## nha6
### כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ (1)
This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.

## zi15
### שַׁלַּ֥ח (1)
**Let** is the first word of a third-level direct quote which continues until the end of [9:19](../09/19.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening third-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a third-level quotation. If you chose to make the second level an indirect quote, this may only be a second-level quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

This verse presents two things that God could have done, but has not. This is to set up the reason in the [next verse](../09/16.md). Be sure that it is clear in your translation that these are hypothetical past events and connect it to the goal in the next verse. (See: [[grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])

## a3l8
### שָׁלַ֣חְתִּי אֶת־יָדִ֔⁠י וָ⁠אַ֥ךְ אוֹתְ⁠ךָ֛ (1)

The statements from **to show** to the end of the verse are the goals of Yahweh’s not yet destroying Egypt and Pharaoh. You will need to translate, **However, for this reason I let you stand: in order** in a way that connects with the [previous verse](../09/15.md) in an action-goal manner. (See: [[grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

## nec7
### וּ⁠לְמַ֛עַן סַפֵּ֥ר שְׁמִ֖⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ (1)

### עוֹדְ⁠ךָ֖ מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל בְּ⁠עַמִּ֑⁠י (1)
Pharaoh’s opposition to letting the Israelites go to worship Yahweh is spoken of as if he was raising himself up as a barrier to them. Alternate translation: “You still block my people” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## sdav
### מִסְתּוֹלֵ֣ל (1)
Here, Pharaoh fills two different roles in the sentence. Different languages have different methods of marking this. Translate this in a way that it is clear that Pharaoh is making himself either proud or the obstacle in the Israelites’ way to freedom. (See: [[figs-rpronouns]])

### שְׁלַ֤ח הָעֵז֙ אֶֽת־מִקְנְ⁠ךָ֔ וְ⁠אֵ֛ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠ךָ֖ בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה (1)
The form of address here is singular, Moses is speaking directly to Pharaoh. However, the next two verses make it clear that Pharaoh’s servants heard and understood this warning to be for them as well. In this sense Pharaoh represents the Egyptians. (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

## fz5d
### וָ⁠מֵֽתוּ (1)
Up to three levels of direct quotation (depending on your earlier decision about converting a level to an indirect quotation) end at the end of this verse. You should indicate that ending here with closing first-level, second-level, and third-level (if required) quotation marks or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the end of quotations within quotations. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

# 9:20

### חָטָ֣אתִי (1)
Some commentators suggest translating this term more literally, that is “to miss the mark,” because Pharaoh is probably not admitting a moral failure. He is admitting that he misjudged.

## joxy
### הַ⁠צַּדִּ֔יק & הָ⁠רְשָׁעִֽים (1)
Many commentators suggest that Pharaoh is using these terms in a narrow, legal sense and only referring to this instance. That is, he is saying something like “I’ve lost this round in court.” See UST.

# 9:30
## tn94
### וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה וַ⁠עֲבָדֶ֑י⁠ךָ (1)
This phrase is shifted to the front of the sentence to mark focus on Pharaoh and his servants because, despite Yahweh demonstrating his power, they are not yet afraid of him. If your language has a form or discourse feature that draws contrastive focus to participants, use it here. (See: [[grammar-connect-condition-contrary]])

## ke5k
### וַ⁠יַּכְבֵּ֥ד לִבּ֖⁠וֹ (1)
Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if he made his own heart heavy. This time his servants do the same. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [8:15](../08/15.md). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh determined to be defiant” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## nz0e
### וַ⁠יֹּ֣סֶף לַ⁠חֲטֹ֑א (1)
This statement is from the author’s perspective. Therefore, unlike in [9:27](../09/27.md), **sin** should be translated with the word your language uses for “sin.”

Pharaoh’s stubborn attitude is spoken of as if his heart was strong. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [Exodus 7:13](../07/13.md). This is a neutral statement (it does not say that anyone caused him to be stubborn as many others in this part of the narrative do). Alternate translation: “Pharaoh was still defiant” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

## gcbh
### כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר דִּבֶּ֥ר יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠יַד־מֹשֶֽׁה (1)
This is similar to [9:12](../09/12.md). In this case, what Yahweh said is figuratively spoken of as if it was something that could be held in someone’s hand. This means that Moses delivered a message from Yahweh that Pharaoh would be stubborn. It is not clear if this message was given to the Israelites or if this refers to Moses’ statement to Pharaoh in [9:30](../09/30.md). (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

### כִּֽי־אֲנִ֞י הִכְבַּ֤דְתִּי אֶת־לִבּ⁠וֹ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־לֵ֣ב עֲבָדָ֔י⁠ו (1)
This means God made Pharaoh and his servants stubborn. Their stubborn attitude is spoken of as if their hearts were heavy. If the heart is not the body part your culture uses to refer to a person’s will, consider using whichever organ your culture would use for this image. See how you translated this in [4:21](../04/21.md), but note that the metaphor is slightly different here. Alternate translation: “for I have caused Pharaoh and his servants to be stubborn” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

### וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו (1)
After this phrase a direct quote begins which continues until near the end of [10:6](../10/06.md). It may be helpful to your readers to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with whatever other punctuation or convention your language uses to indicate the beginning of a quotation. (See: [[figs-quotemarks]])

## db3a
### וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵלָ֗י⁠ו כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָֽ⁠עִבְרִ֔ים (1)
It may be helpful to turn the introductory quotation into an indirect quotation so you do not have to use quotes within quotes. Alternate translation: “and told him that Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, said thus” (See: [[figs-quotations]])

## vze4
### כֹּֽה־אָמַ֤ר יְהוָה֙ (1)
This quote form is used to introduce commands from Yahweh. See [4:intro](../04/intro.md) for more information.

### וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְאֹ֣ת אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ (1)
These parallel statements have a similar meaning. They are used to emphasize the great number of locusts that are coming. In some languages this will not have the same rhetorical effect and you will need to use another device to emphasize the statement. (See: [[figs-parallelism]])

## rdav
### וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ אֶת־עֵ֣ין הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ (1)
“And it will cover the land from sight”

## oj3i
### וְ⁠כִסָּה֙ & וְ⁠אָכַ֣ל & וְ⁠אָכַל֙ (1)
Here, the pronoun **it** agrees in number with the collective singular “locust” in the previous verse. Insects are often referred to without gender in English, but you will need to use whatever number, gender, and/or noun class is required in your language to agree with the word you used in the [previous verse](../10/04.md) for “locust.” See UST. (See: [[figs-collectivenouns]])

# 10:6
## ir5l
### עַל־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה (1)
This could either mean **on the earth** (planet) or “on the land” (Egypt). Either way, it is meant to emphasize an extremely long time, meaning never. (See: [[figs-hyperbole]])

## dmno
### וַ⁠יִּ֥פֶן (1)
[Verse 3](../10/03.md) says that Aaron came in to see the king with Moses. It is implied that he left with him as well. You may make this explicit if it would help your readers. (See: [[figs-explicit]])

# 10:7
## xn8j
### עַד־מָתַי֙ יִהְיֶ֨ה זֶ֥ה לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ לְ⁠מוֹקֵ֔שׁ (1)
Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to show Pharaoh that he is stubbornly causing the destruction of Egypt. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “We cannot allow this man to continue to bring trouble to us!” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## jqbh
### הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים (1)
Here, **men** may be literal or it may refer to the Israelites, including the women and children. In [verse 10](../10/10.md) the king rejects the idea of letting the women and children go and in [verse 11](../10/11.md) he specifically says that the men can go. (See: [[figs-gendernotations]])

## xdm5
### הֲ⁠טֶ֣רֶם תֵּדַ֔ע כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם (1)
Pharaoh’s servants ask this question to bring Pharaoh to recognize what he refuses to see. This rhetorical question can be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You should realize that Egypt is destroyed!” (See: [[figs-rquestion]])

## c6pr
### כִּ֥י אָבְדָ֖ה מִצְרָֽיִם (1)

**May Yahweh be with you** is usually a blessing, but is almost certainly not here. It likely means something like “It will take Yahweh’s power to make me let you and your children go,” or “May Yahweh be as favorable to you as I am to the idea of letting your children go.” Pharaoh is saying that it will take Yahweh to make him do what Moses wants, but he does not think that will happen. Alternate translation: “It will be clear that Yahweh is with you if I let you and your children go”

## w8x4
### רְא֕וּ כִּ֥י רָעָ֖ה נֶ֥גֶד פְּנֵי⁠כֶֽם (1)
The phrase **for evil is before you faces** could either be a warning from Pharaoh that Moses’ actions will lead to evil for the Israelites or it could mean that Pharaoh thinks the Israelites plan something that he considers evil. **Faces** is a metonym for the whole person. Alternate translations: “I see that you plan evil” or “Be careful, your actions will have bad consequences” (See: [[figs-metonymy]])

### אַ֣ךְ הַ⁠פַּ֔עַם & רַ֖ק (1)
Pharaoh could either be desperate and using **just this once... only** to attempt to make his request as small as possible to increase the chances of it being granted or he could be still too proud to admit guilt beyond this single incident (which is probably his bold statement about Yahweh being with the Israelites in [10:10](../10/10.md)). The former seems more likely given that he terms this plague “this death.” If your culture has a way making a request seem as small as possible, you may want to use it to translate Pharaoh’s request.

## kd6d
### אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם (1)
Here, **your** is plural. This could refer either to Moses and Aaron or to all the Israelites. If your language uses different forms of “you” depending on the number of people addressed, use a plural form here. (See: [[figs-youdual]])

### מִצְרָ֑יִם וְ⁠יָמֵ֖שׁ חֹֽשֶׁךְ (1)
This is a somewhat puzzling construction which describes the darkness. Most English translations take it as a passive, which restated actively means, “people will feel the darkness,” meaning metaphorically what is expressed in different ways in the UST and the alternate translation here. Another option is to view the Hebrew verb form as causative and translate as such: “and the darkness will cause people to feel,” meaning people will have to feel where they are going because they will not be able to see. A final option would be a personification of darkness such that the darkness gropes around, filling in every place in the land. Alternate translation: “Egypt—an extremely oppressive darkness” (See: [[figs-metaphor]])

The next few verses are the climax of this part of Exodus. A number of literary features mark it out. First, it is specially introduced with **and so it happened,** which is used to mark major breaks in the narrative. Second, repetition: **firstborn** is repeated four times in verse 29 so that the reader cannot possibly miss what is happening. **Night** is repeated in verse 29, 30, and 31. **Got up/get up** is repeated in verse 30 and 31. In verses 31 and 32 “also” occurs five times (it is translated as “both” once in the ULT). Third, the places of both **Pharaoh** and **the captive** are elaborated on to slow the pace and create a vivid mental image for the reader. In verse 30 there is the listing of sorts of people who got up and the use of the double negative for emphasis. Your translation should attempt to use the same or similar literary features of your own language that slow down the pace, create vivid imagery, and emphasize that this is a climax point.
