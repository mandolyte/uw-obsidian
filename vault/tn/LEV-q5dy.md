# Leviticus 19 General Notes
## Special concepts in this chapter

### Obeying Yahweh

Being holy meant obeying Yahweh in all matters of a person’s life. It is not limited to offering correct sacrifices. The law helped to establish righteousness in a person’s life, as well as justice in Israel. In Israel, these concepts are closely related. (See: [[../bible/kt/holy]] and [[../bible/kt/righteous]] and [[../bible/kt/justice]])
