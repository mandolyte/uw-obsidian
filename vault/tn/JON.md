### קָ֠רָאתִי מִ⁠צָּ֥רָה לִ֛⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי (1)
This line begins a poem describing Jonah’s experience and prayer in the belly of the fish. The poem does not give the exact words that Jonah prayed at the time because the poem was written later, describing Jonah’s experience in the fish, his prayer, and God’s answer as if they had already happened in the past. This first line of the poem can be understood in one of two ways: either as being addressed to Yahweh as part of the description of the prayer, or as being addressed to another person as an introduction to the description of the prayer. See also the Note concerning the phrase “Salvation belongs to Yahweh!” in [2:9](../02/09/jdrh). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

### מִ⁠בֶּ֧טֶן שְׁא֛וֹל (1)

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

## ab77
rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names
### שְׁא֛וֹל (1)
**Sheol** was the name of the place where people went after they died. It was thought to be a shadowy world located somewhere under the ground. The New Testament equivalent seems to be “Hades,” where the dead wait for judgment (see Rev. 20:13). If your language has a word for this place, you may want to use it here, or borrow the word “Sheol.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

## jdrd
rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom
### שָׁמַ֥עְתָּ קוֹלִֽ⁠י (1)
This phrase probably has both a literal and a figurative meaning. The phrase probably means literally that Yahweh heard Jonah’s voice while he was praying inside the belly of the fish. However, the phrase “to hear someone’s voice” in the Old Testament often means “to listen and obey (comply).” In this context, Jonah is expressing that Yahweh both heard him and acted to save him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

In either case, the term probably refers to the fact that Jonah felt certain that he would die. Alternate translation: “but you saved me from dying in a deep place” or “but you saved my life from the place of the dead”

## l2b6
