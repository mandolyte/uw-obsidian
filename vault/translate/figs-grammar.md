## Grammar Topics

What is some basic information about English grammar?

Grammar has two main parts: words and structure. Structure involves how we put words together to form phrases, clauses, and sentences. Here is a brief overview of Grammar Topics we will deal with in detail.

**Parts of Speech** – Every word in a language belongs to a category called a part of speech. (See [Parts of Speech](figs-partsofspeech.md).)

**Sentences** – When we speak, we organize our thoughts in sentences. A sentence usually has a complete thought about an event or a situation or state of being. (See [Sentence Structure](figs-sentences.md).)

* Sentences can be statements, questions, commands, or exclamations. (See [Exclamations](figs-sentencetypes.md).)
* Sentences can have more than one clause. (See [Sentence Structure](figs-sentences.md).)
* Some languages have both active and passive sentences. (See [Active or Passive](figs-activepassive.md).)

**Possession** – This shows that there is a relationship between two nouns. In English it is marked with “of” as in “the love of God,” or with “’s” as in “God’s love,” or with a possessive pronoun as in “his love.” (See [Possession](figs-possession.md).)

**Quotations** – A quotation is a report of what someone else has said.

* Quotations normally have two parts: Information about who said something and what the person said. (See [Quotations and Quote Margins](writing-quotations.md).)
* Quotations can be either direct quotes or indirect quotes. (See [Direct and Indirect Quotations](figs-quotations.md).)
* Quotes can have quotes within them. (See [Quotes within Quotes](figs-quotesinquotes.md).)
* Quotes can be marked to make it easy for readers to understand who said what. (See [Quote Markings](figs-quotemarks.md).)
