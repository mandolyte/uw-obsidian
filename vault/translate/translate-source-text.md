## Choosing a Source Text

What factors should be considered when choosing a source text?

### Factors to Consider for a Source Text

When choosing a source text, there are a number of factors that must be considered:

* **[Statement of Faith](../intro/statement-of-faith.md)** – Does the text agree with the Statement of Faith?
* **[Translation Guidelines](../intro/translation-guidelines.md)** – Does the text agree with the Translation Guidelines?
* **Language** – Is the text in a suitable language that translators and checkers understand well?
* **[Copyrights, Licensing, and Source Texts](translate-source-licensing.md)** – Is the text released under a license that gives sufficient legal freedom?
* **[Source Texts and Version Numbers](translate-source-version.md)** – Is the text the latest, most updated version?
* **[The Original and Source Languages](translate-original.md)** – Does the translation team understand the difference between source languages and original languages?
* **[Original Manuscripts](translate-manuscripts.md)** – Does the translation team understand about Original Manuscripts and [Textual Variants](translate-textvariants.md)?

It is important that the leaders of the churches in the language group agree that the source text is a good one. The Open Bible Stories are available in many source languages on https://ufw.io/stories/. There are also translations of the Bible there to be used as sources for translation in English, and soon, Other Languages, as well.
