### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

the name of a prostitute who lived in Jericho and hid the Israelite spies

#### Glosses: 

Rahab 

#### Explanation: 

Rahab is presented in the New Testament as a model of a Gentile's faith in Israel's God. As described in Joshua 2-6, her faith caused her to aid Israelite spies in the town of Jericho, leading to the eventual downfall of that city during the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Her alignment and identification with God's people resulted in her becoming part of the ancestral line of the Messiah Jesus. The spelling Ραχάβ reflects a pronunciation that is more closely aligned to Rahab's name in Hebrew
