#### Glosses:

Samaria

#### Explanation:

During the Old Testament period of the Divided Monarchy, Samaria was the name that was eventually given to the kingdom containing the northern ten tribes.  When this kingdom was conquered and carried into captivity by the Assyrians (around 722 B.C.), the original Israelite inhabitants were displaced by non-Israelites, who did not strictly worship God according to the Pentateuch's commands.  Their adoption of unauthorized  religious practices resulted in the Jews of Galilee and Judea viewing the Samaritans as little better than pagans.
During the Roman period, the name was used once again to describe an administrative region that was smaller than the earlier Divided Monarchy kingdom. After the death of Herod the Great (A.D. 6), Samaria was incorporated into the Roman province of Judea
