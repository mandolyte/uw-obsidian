## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

a neighbor

#### Glosses: 

a neighbour

#### Explanation: 

γείτων carries the sense of an individual who lives in close proximity to you.  As such, it is the term used in the LXX to describe sharing a Passover Lamb with one's "neighbor," if your own household is small ([Exod 12:4](exo 12:4)). The injunctions of the Mosaic Law related to interacting with one's "neighbor," however, are generally translated by the LXX using the word [πλησίον](../G41390/01.md), which Jesus confirms to be a much broader group of people. See, for example, the second "great commandment", "You shall love your neighbor as yourself" ([πλησίον](../G41390/01.md) [σου](../G47710/01.md) [lev 19:18](Lev 19:18) = Heb.  [רֵעֲךָ](//en-uhl/H7453)) 

#### Citations:
