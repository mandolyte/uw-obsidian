### Sense 1.0:

#### Definition:

#### Glosses:

#### Explanation:

In this sense, ποιέω can be used in a wide variety of ways and can be used for performing most types of activities or actions. Because ποιέω can be used for performing many different types of action, it is important to pay close attention to the context that ποιέω is used in. The context that ποιέω is used in will determine its exact meaning

### Sense 2.0:
 
#### Definition:

to make, produce, or create something material or physical

#### Glosses:

To make, cause, produce, create, prepare, to make ready

#### Explanation:

In this sense, ποιέω is used for creating or producing something material or physical. In this sense, ποιέω can mean to make or produce something by natural processes (such as the ground producing crops), to make something from pre-existing material(s), or it can be used of God creating something out of nothing. When translating ποιέω remember that when it occurs more than one time in the same verse, it can have the same meaning each time it is used or the biblical author may use ποιέω with two different meanings (senses) within the same verse. In Revelation 13:14 there are two occurrences of ποιέω. The first time ποιέω is used in this verse it has the meaning of sense 1.0 (“to perform”). The second time it occurs in this verse it has the meaning of sense 2.0 (“to make”). Revelation 13:14 says, “And he deceives those who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to perform in the presence of the beast, telling those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast.” (NASB) Notice that ποιέω is translated as “to perform” the first time it occurs in this verse, and as “to make” the second time it occurs
