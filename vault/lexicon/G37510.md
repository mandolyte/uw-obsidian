## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

loin, waist, loins (the part above the hips and below the ribs, where a belt is worn.  To the Hebrews, the seat of generative power, that is the loins, the genitals)

#### Glosses: 

loin 

#### Explanation: 

the part above the hips and below the ribs, where a belt is worn.  Hebraically, the seat of generative power, that is the loins, the genitals.  Thus idiomatic uses, such as metaphorical fruit of the loins (referring to descendant[s] or offspring, as Acts 2:30), gird up loins (referring to preparing oneself or getting ready, as Eph. 6:14), and bind up loins of the mind (referring to preparing the mind for action or being alert, as 1 Pet. 1:13)
