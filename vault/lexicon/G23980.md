### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

that which belongs to a person or thing as specifically their own 

#### Glosses: 

One's own

#### Explanation: 

In this sense ἴδιος is used to designate something as belonging to a specific person or specific thing. In Sense 1.0 ἴδιος designates something as not belonging to everyone but rather to the person or persons referred to. In Sense 1.0 ἴδιος can be used to refer to things that belong to a person’s own body or a person’s own property, friends, home, country and other such things that might belong to a person as their own. Sometimes, when combined with other words,  ἴδιος can have other meanings besides its normal or most frequently occurring meanings and therefore it is important to pay close attention to the context ἴδιος is used in, in order to know how to best translate ἴδιος each time that it occurs in the New Testament
