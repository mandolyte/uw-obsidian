## Etymology: 

perhaps through Aramaic: [גֵּיהִנָּם](//en-uhal/H2011), from Hebrew: [גֵּי הִנֹּם](//en-uhal/H2011) = valley of Hinnom ([Neh 11:30](neh 11:30)); [גֵּי בֶּן־הִנֹּם](//en-uhal/H1121)  = valley of the son of Hinnom ([Josh 18:16](jos 18:16)); [גֵּי בּנֵי־הִנֹּם](//en-uhal/H1121)  = valley of the sons of Hinnom ([2Kgs 23:10](4km 23:10));
in LXX several attempts are made to render γέεννα: νάπης γαίεννα ([Josh 18:16](jos 18:16)), Γαὶ Ὀννόμ ([Josh 18:16](jos 18:16)),and φάραγξ Ὀνόμ ([Josh 15:8](jos 15:8)).

## Senses: 

### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

Gehenna

#### Glosses: 

a place of fiery judgment 

#### Explanation: 

Gehenna, a valley west and south of Jerusalem, which was used since the time of Ahaz as a site of child sacrifice to Molech ([2Chr 28:3](2ch 28:3)), was desecrated by Josiah ([2Kgs 23:10](4km 23:10)) and became a dumping-place for the garbage of the city. Because it was a place where the fire was never extinguished, the name became identified as a symbol of the place of future, enduring, fiery punishment. But the future punishment of those who reject Jesus' message is already an active force in their present character, since they are "sons of gehenna"
