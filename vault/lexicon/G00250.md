## Senses: 

### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

to love, feel goodwill toward, or cherish a person in a manner that exceeds mere fondness

#### Glosses: 

to love  

#### Explanation: 

Contrasted with [φιλέω](../G05368/01.md), ἀγαπάω involves feelings toward someone that produce positive actions toward that person, often involving self-sacrifice.  As a result, ἀγαπάω can apply to love between God and man and to love among men. It was such love that motivated God to send His Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, to earth to redeem sinful men by His death and resurrection. Because it is a divine attribute that God extends toward men, God commands His people to demonstrate it to Him and to others (1 Jn 4:10-11)
