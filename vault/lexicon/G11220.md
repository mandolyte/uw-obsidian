#### Explanation: 

Although generally translated as "scribe," the [γραμματεύς](../G11220/01.md) was much more than a copier or writer of documents. Often associated with the Pharisees ([οἱ Φαρισαῖοι](../G53300/01.md), for example [Matt 5:20](mat 5:20)) and the chief priests ([οἱ ἀρχιερεῖς](../G07490/01.md), for example [Matt 20:18](mat 20:18) ), the scribes were teachers who knew and taught the details of the Mosaic Law.  They were often criticized by Jesus for their diligence in keeping the finest points of that Law while failing to see the truth of Jesus' Messianic claims
