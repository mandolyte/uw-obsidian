## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 


#### Definition: 

The totality of something


#### Glosses: 

all, each, every, whole, each and every, entire

#### Explanation: 

This sense of πᾶς describes amount and means the entirety or totality of something and can focus on the individual parts that make up the whole. When πᾶς is used in this sense it means everything or everyone belonging to a certain class, category, or location. Context will help make clear what class of people or thing(s) the biblical author is referring to. For this reason, it is important to pay close attention to the context. For example, in Romans 3:23 Paul says, "For all have sinned" and he means that "all" who are human beings have sinned. Often in the New Testament, πᾶς is used as an adjective, and the noun that πᾶς is describing or quantifying will make clear what group πᾶς is referring to

Every thing that makes up a total of something

 
#### Glosses:

Paul’s focus is on the fact that God has made each individual spiritual blessing that it is possible to possess, available to Christians through Christ

This sense refers to one or more things within a group of things and focuses on the individual thing(s) within the group.

The phrase "κατὰ (../G25960/01.md)for, πᾶσαν αἰτίαν(../G01560/01.md) "cause, reason" could be translated as "for every cause" or "for any reason." Here πᾶσαν is being used to mean any single possible reason that a man might have for wanting to divorce his wife. The thing(s) referred to can be real or they can be possible things

### Sense  5.0: 

#### Definition: 

In this sense πᾶς is used as a pronoun and takes the place of a noun, meaning it functions as a noun

#### Glosses: 

Everyone, all, all men, all people, all things, everything, every one, every way

#### Explanation: 

When πᾶς is used in the place of a noun it is functioning as a pronoun. When used as a pronoun πᾶς may have the meaning of one of the other senses. Because it is being used in place of a noun and not describing or quantifying a noun, the translator must decide what sense (meaning) πᾶς has from the context it is being used in. For example in John 3:16 πᾶς has the meaning of "everyone" or "each and everyone" and is being used in [Sense 2.0](#sense-20). In 2 Corinthians 9:8 παντὶ (the dative neuter singular form of πᾶς) is being used as a pronoun and also has the meaning of [Sense 2.0](#sense-20) and could be translated as "every way" or "each and every way"
