## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

milk, viewed either literally or metaphorically as relating to teaching from the Word of God

#### Glosses: 

milk

#### Explanation: 

Milk can be viewed in a literal sense as a beverage as in [1Cor 9:7](1co 9:7). The nourishing properties of milk, particularly for the young, make it a fitting metaphor for the teaching of the Word of God that enables Christians to grow spiritually. At times milk is viewed as introductory teaching for new Christians and is contrasted with solid food, which is for mature Christians ([1Cor 3:2](1co 3:2), [Heb 5:12](heb 5:12), [13](heb 5:13).
But in Peter ([1Pet 2:2](1pe 2:2)), pure spiritual milk is viewed as the nourishment that all believers should continue to seek for their growth in salvation
