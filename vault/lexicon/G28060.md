### Sense 1.0:

#### Definition: 

To break something into pieces (only used in the New Testament for breaking a loaf of bread into pieces)

#### Glosses:

break, break in pieces

#### Explanation:

When used in some New Testament passages with the word ἄρτος "bread" these two words together form the phrase "to break bread" which refers to the entire event of having a meal. κλάω occurs with ἄρτος with this use in the New Testament in reference to the Lord's Supper and the early Christians practice of celebrating it together during a meal. The use of this phrase to symbolize a meal comes from the fact that in Jewish culture the father of a household would begin a meal by breaking bread which indicated the beginning of the meal.
