### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

to exercise, train

#### Glosses: 

In secular Greek, to exercise naked, used in the NT to describe spiritual training

#### Explanation: 

The association with being naked ([γυμνός](../G11310/01.md)) stems from the fact that Greek athletes traditionally exercised naked in order to eliminate any impediment to their athletic performance.  By far, the majority of NT references to [γυμνός](../G11310/01.md), however, relate to people who are destitute of any (or, at least, of adequate) clothing

#### Citations: 

~referring to training one's body: [Heb 12:11](heb 12:11), ~or of training in spiritual behaviors: [1Tim 4:7](1ti 4:7), [Heb 5:14](heb 5:14), [2Pet 2:14](2pe 2:14).
