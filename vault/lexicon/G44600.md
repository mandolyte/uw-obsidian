### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

The name of a Caananite prostitute who lived in the city of Jericho and hid the Israelite spies

#### Glosses: 

Rahab

#### Explanation: 

Rahab is presented in the New Testament as a model of a Gentile's faith in Israel's God (A Gentile is someone who is not Jewish). As described in Joshua chapters 2-6, her faith caused her to help Israelite spies in the town of Jericho, leading to the eventual downfall of that city during the Israelite conquest of Canaan. Her alignment and identification with God's people resulted in her becoming part of the ancestral line of Jesus the Messiah
