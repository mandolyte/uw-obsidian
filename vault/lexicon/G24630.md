### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

a rainbow 

#### Glosses: 

rainbow

#### Explanation: 

It is possible that in Revelation 4:3 ἶρις is a circle of light that is not the same as a rainbow in which case ἶρις could be translated as "circle of light" but it is hard to tell which is meant in Revelation 4:3 so translating it as "rainbow" is acceptable
