## Senses:

### Sense 1.0:

#### Definition: 

A point in time or a time span during which some event happens and often having the implication that the time is the right time or the suitable time for an event to happen, the season in which something takes place 

#### Glosses:

time, right time, proper time, opportune time, opportunity, occasion, season, period

#### Explanation:

When used in Sense 1.0 καιρός refers to an occurrence in time rather than to a duration of time.    
The two Greek phrases "πρὸς καιρόν" and "πρὸς καιρὸν ὥρας" are idioms and function as word units. When they are encountered in the New Testament they should be translated together. They refer to an event that lasts for only a relatively short period of time and together they can be translated as "for a little while" or  "for a while" or "not long"
