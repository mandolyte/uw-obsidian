### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

 a person from the region of Samaria
 
#### Glosses: 

a Samaritan

#### Explanation: 

Because of the low esteem in which first century Jews held the Samaritans, referring to someone as a "Samaritan" was often used as a term of derision as in [John 8:49](jhn 8:48) 

#### Citations: 

[Matt 10:5](mat 10:5), [Luke 9:52](luk 9:52) [10:33](luk 10:33) [17:16](luk 17:16), [John 4:9](jhn 4:9), [39, 40](jhn 4:39-40), [8:48](jhn 8:48), [Acts 8:25](act 8:25).
