### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

to sift or winnow

#### Glosses: 

to sift, winnow

#### Explanation: 

Winnowing is a process used in many agricultural societies to separate the desriable portion of grain (such as the kernel of wheat) from the worthless portion (the chaff) by tossing the grain into the air with a pitchfork.  The kernel is heavier and falls back to the ground to be collected, while the chaff is lighter and is carried away by the wind
