### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

a stone in general or when used in combination with different explaing words a stone that is formed into something or a stone that is a specific type of stone

#### Glosses: 

stone

#### Explanation: 

Literally, a stone.  It is important to pay attention to context when determining what kind of stone is referred to by λίθος.  The word λίθος may indicate stone as a substance, a piece of rock, or a certain kind of stone.  When used for a large stone in the New Testament, λίθος refers to a movable stone that can be relocated to another position, as in Matt 27:60.  In combination with other words, however, λίθος is frequently used of a particular kind of stone.  For example, λίθος [τίμιος](../G50930/01.md), of a precious stone or a jewel, or λίθος [μυλικός](../G34570/01.md) , of a millstone (Rev 18:21).  Of building stones, compare Matt 24:2, Mark 13:1, and Luke 19:44.  Used of the tablets of the law, compare 2 Cor 3:7
