#### Definition:

#### Glosses: 

Rephan

#### Explanation: 
In [Amos 5:26](amo 5:26) the prophet reprimands the Israelites for worshipping certain foreign gods during the wilderness wanderings.  The Hebrew text refers to these gods as "Sikkuth your king" and Kiyyun. Perhaps attempting to identify these gods who were unknown to the translators, the LXX rendered  [מַלְכְּכֶם](//en-uhal/H4428) as a proper name, transforming "Sikkuth your king" into "the tabernacle of Molech" and rendered Kiyyun by the god's (apparently) Egyptian name as Ραιφαν.  The lack of any knowledge of the god Ῥεμφάν (or Ῥαιφάν) in other Biblical literature is likely responsible for the multiple alternate spellings.  In Acts 7:43 some manuscripts read Ῥομφά or Ῥαιφάν

#### Citations: 
[Acts 7:43](act 7:43).
