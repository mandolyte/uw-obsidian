### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

Abram, Abraham, the father of Isaac, and grandfather of Jacob

#### Glosses: 

Abraham

#### Explanation: 

God changed Abram's name to Abraham in Genesis 17.  The distinction between the two Hebrew names is not reflected in the New Testament Greek references.  The New Testament views Abraham not only as the physical father of Jacob's descendants, but also as the spiritual father of all those who have the kind of faith that Abraham demonstrated
