## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

To believe that something is true 

#### Glosses: 
 
believe, be convinced

#### Explanation: 

This sense of πιστεύω means “to believe” that something is true, reliable information, or accurate. This sense is used in James 2:19 where James writes, “You believe that there is one God, you do well. But even the demons believe that, and they tremble” (ULT). James is saying that the demons believe the fact or truth that there is only one God. This sense is different than Sense 2.0. because Satan and demons do not believe in God in Sense 2.0

### Sense  2.0: 

#### Definition: 

To believe in someone or something, to entrust your entire self to someone or something with total confidence (often used in a religious sense)

#### Glosses: 

believe, believe (in), have faith, have faith (in)


#### Explanation: 

This sense of πιστεύω means to have faith in someone or something and is often used in the New Testament of believing in Jesus, God, or the gospel or used for believing in something that God says or does. When πιστεύω is used with the prepositions [ἐν](../G17220), [ἐπί](G19090), or [εἰς](../G15190) the meaning is frequently, “to believe in” or “to believe on.” Πιστεύω can be used as a transitive verb or as an intransitive verb. Used intransitively πιστεύω means, “to have faith” or “to believe” and does not have a direct object.  (An intransitive verb does not require a direct object. An example of an intransitive verb is the verb “wept” in the sentence, “Jesus wept.” The verb “wept” does not require a direct object. The opposite of an intransitive verb is a transitive verb. A transitive verb does require a direct object. In the sentence “Judas betrayed Jesus” the verb “betrayed” is a transitive verb and requires a direct object because “Judas betrayed” is an incomplete thought by itself and requires the direct object “Jesus” in order to make the thought complete)
