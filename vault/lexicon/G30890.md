### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

to loosen or release or untie someone or something that has been tied or bound 

#### Glosses: 

to loose, to untie, unbind, release, set free 

#### Explanation: 

λύω is sometimes used literally and sometimes used figuratively in the New Testament. The two most common meanings of λύω in the New Testament are “to loosen” and “to reduce or divide a whole into its parts” but λύω can have other meanings in the New Testament also which only context can make clear. Literally λύω means to loose or untie. λύω can be used for loosing, unbinding, untying, or releasing a variety of things such as sandals (see Mark 1:7 and Luke 3:16), animals (see Matt 21:2 and Luke 13:15), people (see John 11:44 and Acts 22:30), or Satan (see Rev 20:3 and Rev 20:7).  Figuratively λύω can mean “to loose” or “to release”. For example, it is used of being loosed from the marriage tie in 1Corinthians 7:27, and of the diseased woman in Luke 13:16 being released from her disease, and it is used spiritually in Rev 1:5 for being released from sin
