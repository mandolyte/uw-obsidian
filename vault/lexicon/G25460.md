#### Explanation:

κἀκεῖ is a combination of the two Greek words [καὶ](../G25320/01.md): which can mean "and" or "also" when used by itself and the word [ἐκεῖ](../G15630/01.md) which means "there" and when these two words are contracted together they form the word κἀκεῖ and context must determine how to translate it in each passage it occurs in
