### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

meaning unknown

#### Glosses: 

(lit.) second-first; 

#### Explanation: 

This word likely resulted from an early scribal mistake at Luke 6:1 and does not occur elsewhere.  Many editions and translations omit the word.  If it was an authentic word it was apparently a technical term used to specify a special Sabbath.

#### Citations: 

second-first (in what sense, there is no satisfactory explanation. The reading is prob. not original, v. ICC, in l.; DCG, i, 411; ii, 541, 724): [Lk 6:1](Luk 6:1), WH, mg., R, mg.†
