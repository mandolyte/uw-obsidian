## Senses: 


### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

a region of Palestine north of Samaria in New Testament times

#### Glosses: 

Galilee

#### Explanation: 

In the OT, the name Galilee was applied to some of the territory of the tribes of Naphtali and Dan in the northern-most portion of Israel.  As king, Solomon gave Hiram, king of Tyre, twenty cities in Galilee, possibly leading to the notion of "Galilee of the Gentiles" ([1Km 9:1](isa 9:1), [Matt 4:15](mat 4:15)). The Romans later divided Palestine into three primary regions -- Galilee, Samaria, and Judea (from north to south), with Galilee being little esteemed by the residents of Judea
