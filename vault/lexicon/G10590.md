Gamaliel was the influential voice in the Jewish Council who successfully argued that the Council should assess the apostles' teaching of the risen Jesus on its merits, rather than persecute the apostles.  Paul names Gamaliel as his mentor, again attesting to Gamaliel's reputation for skill in interpreting the OT Law
