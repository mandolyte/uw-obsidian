### Sense  1.0: 

#### Definition: 

an angle, a corner

#### Glosses: 

a corner

#### Explanation: 

Because of its perfect rectangular cut, a cornerstone defined the direction of the four walls of a building and ensured that the walls extending from it would follow the architectural plan.  The "chief" or main cornerstone was the first of the four such cornerstones to be laid and thus established the plan, integrity, and stability of the entire building

Jesus and the New Testament writers cite the reference to the "chief cornerstone", the [κεφαλὴ](../G27760/01.md) γνωνίας ([רֹאשׁ פִּנָּה](//en-uhal/H7218)), in [Ps 118:22](psa 118:22) (LXX = Ps 117:22) as pertaining to Jesus, who, though rejected by men, is indeed the Lord's Messiah
