#### Definition: 

Hades, the abode of the dead, with no attribution of judgment or bliss

#### Glosses: 

Hades, the abode of the dead

#### Explanation: 

This usage is a translation of the Hebrew concept of Sheol [שְׁאוֹל](//en-uhl/H75850) and a direct reference to [Ps 15:10](psa 15:10){LXX}.
Greek mythology recognized the god Hades as the guardian of the nether-world, where all men lived hopelessly after death. While the Hebrew Sheol has some superficial similarities to this Greek concept, Sheol appears to be a place where God is actively involved with His saints
